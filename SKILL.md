name: just-do-it
description: One command that takes a single objective through a full, gated development process using expert subagents. Use when the user types "/just-do-it", says "just do it", "build me X end to end", "take this from idea to shipped", or hands off a whole objective for autonomous delivery. Three modes — GREENFIELD (ship a new production-grade app, with market/demand validation up front), DEBUG (root-cause a complex bug in web or other software), LEGACY (add a feature inside a large/legacy codebase). Borrows oh-my-symphony's gated-lane + shared-vault + adversarial-verify + literal-delivery-gate model, runs it self-contained with in-session subagents — no external orchestrator, TUI, or CLI install.

# /just-do-it

One objective in, a verified result out. The skill is the **conductor**: it never writes
production code itself — it decomposes the objective, dispatches **expert subagents** through a
**forward-only pipeline**, and refuses to declare success until a **machine-checkable gate** passes.

The design is borrowed from `oh-my-symphony` (gated lanes, a single shared vault, untrusted
`claims.md` re-verified by an adversary, a literal-bash delivery gate that is never edited to pass)
but stripped of the heavy Symphony CLI / TUI / worktree infrastructure — everything runs in-session
with the `Task`/`Agent` tool, so there is nothing to install.

## Why this exists

A single agent given a big objective drifts: it skips validation, trusts its own "done", and leaves
unverified claims. `/just-do-it` imposes the discipline a senior team would: validate before
building, separate the builder from the verifier, prove every claim by re-running it, and gate
delivery on evidence — not on the agent's own say-so.

## Use when

- "/just-do-it build a habit-tracker app and ship it"
- "/just-do-it the checkout page hangs intermittently in production — fix it"
- "/just-do-it add SSO to our legacy Django monolith"
- The user hands off a whole objective and wants the full process run autonomously.

## Do NOT use when

- A single, well-scoped edit ("rename this variable") — just do it directly.
- Pure brainstorming with no intent to build — use `brainstorming`.
- The user wants to drive each step themselves — use `ultrawork` / `using-symphony`.

## Step 0 — Mode detection (ALWAYS do this first)

Read the objective and classify it. State the detected mode to the user in one line before proceeding.

| Signal in the objective | Mode | Pipeline (see `reference/pipeline.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| "build / make / ship / launch a new app/product/site/tool" | **GREENFIELD** | Intake → **Validate** → Plan → Build → Verify → QA → Deliver |
| "fix / broken / failing / crash / hang / regression / why does" | **DEBUG** | Intake → Reproduce → Diagnose → Fix → Verify → Deliver |
| "add / integrate X into existing/legacy/our codebase" | **LEGACY** | Intake → Explore → Plan → Build → Verify → QA → Deliver |

If ambiguous, ask ONE clarifying question, then proceed. Mode picks the pipeline; the gates and the
vault are identical across modes.

**Topology rule** (the research thesis — task shape, not preference, picks the architecture):
fan out parallel subagents only for *wide-and-shallow* work (Validate research, scaffolding several
modules). Keep a *single driving agent* for *deep-and-narrow* work — so **DEBUG and LEGACY default to
single-driver** with isolated helpers only for independent probes, and both open in **read-only Plan
Mode with human approval before the first write**. Details in `reference/pipeline.md`.

## The non-negotiable gates

These are the spine. Never weaken or skip them; never edit a gate to make it pass
(`reference/quality-gates.md`).

1. **Validate-before-build** (GREENFIELD): no Build ticket opens until `validation.md` shows real
   demand evidence and a scoped MVP. Kills "nobody wanted this" failures.
2. **Plan freezes scope**: `plan.md` is written once and frozen; Build implements it, does not redesign.
3. **Builder ≠ Verifier**: the agent that writes code does not get to approve it. A fresh **adversarial
   Verify** agent re-runs every `run-to-prove` command in `claims.md` from a clean state.
4. **Multi-expert review before deliver**: architect + security-reviewer + code-reviewer run in
   parallel; ALL must approve (`reference/experts.md`).
5. **Literal delivery gate**: `templates/delivery-gate.sh` must exit 0 — required artifacts present,
   an aggregate `verdict: GREEN` with no line-start `verdict: RED`, `Decision: GO` for greenfield, and
   the project's own tests pass. The skill cannot announce "done" otherwise.
6. **Bounded retry + circuit breaker**: max 5 fix cycles per phase; the SAME error 3× → stop, write
   the root cause to `decisions.log`, escalate to the user. Never loop forever.

## The vault (only cross-phase state)

Every run creates `./.just-do-it/<slug>/` — the single blackboard every phase reads from and writes
to. Phases run as fresh subagent contexts, so the vault is how they communicate. Full contract in
`reference/vault.md`. Core files: `brief.md`, `validation.md` (greenfield), `plan.md` (frozen),
`claims.md` (append-only, untrusted), `verification.md` (verdicts), `decisions.log`, `state.json`.

## Expert roster

Roles are dispatched as subagents, each a fresh context with the minimum vault read-set (role
separation by read-scope). Model tier is matched to task complexity (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus). See
`reference/experts.md` for the dispatch table, parallel-wave rules, and which existing agent type
(`analyst`, `architect`, `executor`, `security-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `qa-tester`, `debugger`,
`verifier`) plays each role.

## Reference map (progressive disclosure — load only what the current phase needs)

| Read this | When |
|---|---|
| `reference/pipeline.md` | Always — the phase definitions and exit gates for the detected mode |
| `reference/experts.md` | When dispatching any phase — role → agent-type → model-tier map |
| `reference/vault.md` | At Intake (create vault) and whenever a phase passes state |
| `reference/market-research.md` | GREENFIELD Validate phase — demand-validation methods |
| `reference/quality-gates.md` | Verify, Review, and Deliver phases — what "production-ready" means |
| `reference/debugging.md` | DEBUG mode Diagnose phase — hypothesis-driven root-cause method |

## Escalation & stop conditions

- Circuit breaker tripped (same error 3×) → stop, root-cause to user.
- Validate phase finds no demand evidence (GREENFIELD) → stop, report; do not build on spec.
- Delivery gate cannot pass after fixes → report exactly which check fails; never fake the gate.
- Destructive or irreversible step needed (drop data, force-push, external publish) → ask first.

## Final checklist (before claiming done)

- [ ] Mode stated and correct pipeline run
- [ ] Every `claims.md` entry has a GREEN verdict in `verification.md` from the adversarial pass
- [ ] architect + security + code-review all approved
- [ ] `delivery-gate.sh` exited 0 — paste the output as evidence
- [ ] `decisions.log` captures the key choices and any escalations
- [ ] Reported what was verified, with command output — no unverified "done"
