# /supergoal

**English** | [한국어](README.ko.md)

**One objective in, a verified result out - the smallest correct change, checked against the real tests.**
No extra install: clone the repo, symlink it into your skills directory, then `/supergoal <objective>`.
Landing page: **[cskwork.github.io/supergoal-skill](https://cskwork.github.io/supergoal-skill/)**.

An agent skill that takes a single objective, surfaces the requirements that are not in the prompt,
makes the smallest correct change, and verifies it against the project's own tests and spec - then stops.

## What it adds over a plain baseline

A strong model with the real spec is the bar. `/supergoal` adds only what a plain baseline cannot do for
free: it surfaces the requirements that are **not in the prompt** - as FAILING tests written by an
independent critic - then makes the smallest correct change and verifies it against the project's real
tests and spec, never a generated proxy. For a trivial single edit, skip the skill and edit directly.

Each role is a bundled file in `agents/`, so dispatch stays harness-agnostic across Claude Code, Codex,
agy, and other agent CLIs - but dispatch is optional and single-driver by default.

## Principles

- **Verify against ground truth.** Re-run the project's REAL tests and re-read the prose spec for rules
  the tests miss. Never generate a proxy checklist/verifier and optimize to it.
- **Smallest correct change.** Match the surrounding code; no whole-file rewrites to change a few lines.
- **Surface hidden requirements first.** The one place a process beats a plain baseline.
- **Ask only when genuinely ambiguous.** Resolve code-answerable questions by reading the code.
- **Hard stops.** A destructive/irreversible step needs consent; if the real tests cannot pass, report it -
  never fake a pass.

## Modes

`/supergoal` detects the mode from your objective:

| Objective looks like | Mode | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| "build / ship a new app/tool" | **GREENFIELD** | default loop |
| "fix / broken / failing / why does" | **DEBUG** | default loop; reproduce with a failing test first |
| "add X to our existing/legacy code" | **LEGACY** | default loop; map the code first; refactoring an existing API: capture its exact behavior first, Verify diffs against that baseline |
| "spec this first - requirements/design/tasks docs" | **SPEC** | grill load-bearing decisions one question at a time; requirements -> design -> tasks crystallize under `docs/spec/`, then the default loop runs against them |
| "explain / teach me X" (no code) | **TEACH** | Mission -> Source -> Bridge -> Teach -> Check (explain-back) |
| "learn / map / onboard onto this codebase" | **LEARN-DOMAIN** | Survey -> Map -> Ground -> Persist a `.domain-agent/` wiki |
| "QA only / verify / compare data - no code" | **QA-ONLY** | Exercise app + read-only DB -> evidence -> `report.md` |
| "review / audit this code/diff/PR - no fixes" | **REVIEW-ONLY** | Two independent reviewers -> verified findings -> `report.md` |
| "improve the architecture / find refactoring opportunities" | **ARCH** | Friction survey -> candidates `report.md` -> grill the pick -> refactor routes to LEGACY/SPEC |
| "test harness effectiveness / with vs without" | **HARNESS-EVAL** | Cases -> baseline run -> harness run -> machine checks -> quality score -> compare |
| "make a skill from history - no product code" | **SKILL-MINE** | Mine history -> rank -> you pick -> forge portable `SKILL.md` -> install |

**Default loop (GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY), role-separated:** 1) **Frame** the goal + acceptance
criteria; 2) **Build** the smallest correct change, test-first (bug -> failing test first); 3) an
independent **Critic** re-reads the spec and writes a FAILING test for each required behavior the existing
tests miss; 4) a **Fixer** makes those pass with the smallest change; 5) **Verify** against the real tests
and re-read the spec for uncovered rules - stop on green and report what was verified with command output.

Coding/debug runs use a run worktree by default: resolve and verify the source/base branch plus the
target/integration branch before editing, create the run worktree from source/base, and only commit or
merge into the verified target/integration branch after green verification and user acceptance. Browser UI
changes also require real browser QA: `Tool: playwright-cli` evidence and `qa-gate.sh <vault> browser`.

```text
/supergoal build a habit-tracker app and ship it
/supergoal the checkout page hangs intermittently in prod. fix it
/supergoal add SSO to our legacy Django monolith
/supergoal learn this codebase and build a domain wiki
/supergoal QA the checkout flow on staging and check the order totals match the DB (no code change)
/supergoal compare this migration harness with and without the harness on 3 cases
```

QA-ONLY, REVIEW-ONLY, ARCH, TEACH/LEARN-DOMAIN, HARNESS-EVAL, and SKILL-MINE are kept as separate-purpose
utilities (no-code QA, findings-only review, teaching/onboarding, harness measurement, skill forging).
They write no product code by default and confirm with you before installing anything.

## Board (optional live dashboard)

Watch progress across concurrent agents in real time. `bash tui/launch.sh &` opens an in-browser
dashboard (Textual) showing each agent's mode + workflow stage (Frame -> Build -> Critic -> Fixer ->
Verify) and a Jira-like task board, grouped by repo / branch / worktree. Branch is advisory - never
locked, so multiple agents can share a branch freely.

It is pure observability: opt-in, best-effort, and it never gates or blocks a run - if no agent emits,
every mode still passes unchanged. When enabled, the conductor calls `sg-emit`
(`templates/observability/`) at each phase transition, writing one atomically-replaced heartbeat JSON
per agent under `~/.supergoal/runs/agents/`; the dashboard (`tui/`) polls and renders them. Correctness
is just one writer per file + atomic rename - no lock anywhere. In-browser serving needs
`pip install textual-serve`; without it, run the local TUI with `python -m tui.app`. Full spec:
[`reference/observability.md`](reference/observability.md).

## Install

This repo **is** the skill. Put it where your agent CLI finds skills:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cskwork/supergoal-skill.git
# then either symlink or copy it into the skills dir your agent uses:
ln -s "$(pwd)/supergoal-skill" <your-agent-skills-dir>/supergoal
# examples: ~/.claude/skills/supergoal, ~/.codex/skills/supergoal, ~/.agents/skills/supergoal
```

Then in your agent CLI: `/supergoal <your objective>`.

### Windows

The skill runs on Windows; the remaining gate/test scripts are POSIX shell, so run them under **Git Bash**
or **WSL** (`node` must be on `PATH`). The repo pins `.gitattributes eol=lf`. Install by **copy** if
symlinks need admin rights (`cp -R` in Git Bash/WSL, or `mklink /D` from an elevated `cmd`); run the
contract tests under **WSL** bash.

## Evidence

The design is grounded in head-to-head evals - `docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-*` and
`log/changelog-2026-06-07.md` (3 cases, 2 models, 4 harness forms). The result that shapes the skill: on
tasks with an explicit spec, a strong baseline that reads the real spec is the bar to beat, and optimizing
to a generated-proxy verifier can score worse via Goodhart. `examples/url-shortener/` is a worked example
service exercised across the build, debug, and extend modes.
