# QA-ONLY mode - exercise + verify a running app, write no code

Use when the user wants QA, data verification, or a data comparison and explicitly NOT a code change:
"QA만", "qa only", "검증만 해줘", "데이터 정합성 확인", "API 수정 전후 확인", "A/B 테스트", "데이터 비교".

QA-ONLY drives an already-running app (and a read-only DB) like a user, builds a detailed impact model
around the feature under test, records what worked / what didn't / what it discovered in a human report,
and persists a reusable, indexed QA suite so the same check re-runs fast later. It writes NO production
code, runs NO build, creates NO worktree, and runs none of the default-loop phases (no Build/Critic/Fixer).
It is read-only except
the run folder and the `.domain-agent/qa/` suite.

If the request actually needs a fix or feature, this is the wrong mode — route to DEBUG/LEGACY and use
QA there as a phase. QA-ONLY never edits product code, even to "quickly" fix what it finds; it reports
the finding and stops.

## Pipeline

`Intake -> Target & Access -> Impact Matrix -> Scenario checkpoint -> Exercise -> Cross-check -> Report -> Persist`

| Phase | Goal | Writes | Exit gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Intake | Capture QA goal, comparison type, acceptance, supplied change/release context | `brief.md`, `state.json` | goal + comparison type stated |
| Target & Access | Resolve running-app target (URL/env, NOT built from repo), browser driver, read-only DB access, action budget | `brief.md` | target reachable; driver + DB access named; `action_cap` set (default 100) |
| Impact Matrix | Infer the feature's direct, adjacent, before/during/after, data, role, viewport, and failure-risk surface | `brief.md` | coverage plan has priority tiers and explicit exclusions |
| Scenario checkpoint | Show the detailed scenario list + budget + comparison type; let the user narrow | run note | user confirms or narrows; proceed unless told to wait |
| Exercise | Drive the app through scenarios via `qa-auditor`, capped | `verification.md` `## QA`, `qa/`, `state.json` | each scenario pass/fail recorded; combined `action_count` written to `state.json`, `<= action_cap` |
| Cross-check | Read-only DB checks via `db-reader`: auth, source-of-truth expected values, dataset/env diff | `verification.md` `## QA`, `qa/` | each check pass/fail + small diff recorded; no raw dumps |
| Report | Human-friendly result with coverage, reproduction steps, and remaining risk | `report.md` | required report headings present |
| Persist | Save reusable suite, index it | `.domain-agent/qa/<suite>.md`, `index.md` | suite + re-run steps saved; no secrets/PII; path gitignored |

## Target & Access

- **Target.** QA-ONLY tests an existing running app. Ask for the URL/environment (e.g. `http://localhost:3000`,
  staging). Only start a local server if the user asks; never build product code to get one. Static
  single HTML opens via `file://`.
- **Browser driver.** `playwright-cli` is the only driver (`reference/playwright-cli.md`); install it if
  absent, record `Tool: playwright-cli` in `## QA`. Authenticated/logged-in sessions use playwright-cli's
  native session/state/CDP-attach paths - no separate tool. See `reference/qa.md` "Authenticated sessions".
- **Navigation map.** Load `.domain-agent/qa/nav-map.md` first to reach gated/popup-heavy screens;
  build it on first entry and correct any drifted rows in place (`reference/qa.md` "Navigation map").
- **DB access.** Read-only, DB-independent, via `reference/db-access.md`. Used for: fetch test
  auth/credentials, verify UI values against the DB source of truth, and run dataset/environment diffs.

## Impact Matrix (detailed QA model)

Before listing scenarios, build an **Impact Matrix** from the user request, supplied release note/diff
summary if any, nav-map, domain pack, screen/API calls, and observable app behavior. The matrix is the
reasoning layer that prevents "the changed button works" from hiding adjacent regressions.

Include:

- **Feature under test.** The user/business outcome, not just the route or button label.
- **before/during/after actions.** Before: auth, role, permissions, settings, seed/existing data, entry
  route. During: happy path, edge values, validation failure, retry, cancel, duplicate submit, repeated
  run. After: refresh, back/forward, reopen, logout/login, revisit from another route, and verify the
  value/state where users naturally expect it next.
- **Adjacent surfaces.** Screens, tabs, API calls, DB tables, cache/storage, notifications, exports/files,
  search/list views, counters, totals, and permissions that share the same state.
- **Displayed data.** Check displayed data accuracy and consistency across the feature's state propagation
  paths: after create/update/delete/status-change, the same value should appear consistently in the
  detail view, list/search results, counters/totals, dashboards, notifications, exports, related records,
  and persisted source-of-truth when those surfaces exist.
- **Feature-specific scenario families.** Pick the family that matches the web feature instead of forcing
  a generic CRUD path:
  - CRUD/content publishing: create -> list/search -> detail -> edit -> refresh/reopen -> delete/archive.
  - Workflow/status transitions: start -> approve/reject/cancel -> downstream queue/list/badge update.
  - Commerce/booking: select -> price/availability -> cart/reservation -> payment/confirmation -> history.
  - Auth/account/settings: login/session -> permission change -> protected routes -> logout/relogin.
  - Search/filter/sort/pagination: query -> filter/sort/page change -> item open -> back preserves state.
  - Upload/download/export: upload -> preview/metadata -> persisted listing -> download/export content.
  - Realtime/notification: trigger event -> toast/badge/feed -> refresh/reconnect consistency.
- **Complexity probes.** Include complex multi-step scenarios such as create -> edit -> save -> reopen,
  partial failure -> retry, role switch, concurrent/repeated action, stale-cache refresh, empty data,
  high/low boundary values, mobile/desktop viewport, and keyboard/a11y navigation when relevant.
- **Risk tier.** Mark each scenario `must`, `should`, or `could`. Run all `must` items first, then
  highest-risk `should` items until the action cap is reached. Never mark an unrun item as covered.

If a scenario cannot be tested because access, data, fixture, role, browser state, DB credentials, or
budget is missing, list it as uncovered with the reason and the residual risk. Do not silently compress
a detailed QA request into a single happy-path smoke.

## Comparison types

State one in `brief.md` `Comparison:`; it picks what the Cross-check phase compares.

| `Comparison:` | Compares | How |
|---|---|---|
| `functional` | scenario outcome vs expected behavior | drive the Impact Matrix must-paths, edge paths, and adjacent checks; assert each step |
| `data-integrity` | UI value vs DB source of truth | read the value on screen, query the DB, diff |
| `before-after` | a saved baseline suite vs the app now (regression after an API/code change) | re-run a persisted `.domain-agent/qa/<suite>.md`; diff against its baseline |
| `ab` | variant A vs variant B (A/B test arms) | run the same scenario on each arm; diff outcome/data |
| `env` | environment A vs environment B | run the same scenario/query on each; diff outcome/data |

## Action cap (anti-context-overload)

Each browser interaction (`open/click/type/fill/snapshot/screenshot`) and each DB query counts as one
QA action. Default `action_cap` is **100** (override per run at Target & Access for a known-large flow).
The conductor splits the budget by comparison type: `functional` gives all to `qa-auditor` (no DB);
DB comparisons reserve a small `db-reader` sub-budget and give the rest to `qa-auditor`. Each agent
honors its sub-budget and reports its count; the conductor sums them into `state.json.action_count` (this
write is the Exercise/Cross-check exit). At the cap a subagent STOPS and reports what is done and what
remains; the conductor writes the report and asks whether to continue with a fresh budget. The gate
fails if `action_count > action_cap`. The cap exists so a run stays scoped and the user does not get
lost in an unbounded crawl.

## Vault (reduced run folder)

`docs/changelog/<YYYY-MM>/<DD-qa-topic>/` with: `brief.md`, `verification.md` (machine `## QA` evidence),
`report.md` (human), `qa/scenario-ledger.md`, `qa/` (evidence files), `state.json`. No `plan.md` — nothing is
planned-to-ship. The per-run report stays here; the reusable suite goes to the
domain pack (below).

## Report (the one human-facing deliverable)

Write `report.md` from `templates/qa-report.md`, in the target repo's dominant docs language under
English anchor headings; if docs are mixed or absent, use the user's language. Lead with the verdict,
then coverage, then per-scenario pass/fail with the evidence path, then concrete
findings (e.g. a UI value that disagreed with the DB), reproduction steps for every issue, what was not
covered, and the exact command/suite to re-run. Keep it readable by a non-engineer.

For each issue, include enough for a human to reproduce without reading the transcript: target URL/env,
role/account type (not credentials), starting state, exact clicks/inputs, expected result, actual result,
and evidence path. If a failure is intermittent, record how many attempts were made and which attempt
failed.

## Persist (repeatable + indexed)

Save the run as a reusable suite under the domain pack (`reference/domain-context.md` saving loop):

- `.domain-agent/qa/<suite>.md`: Impact Matrix, scenario list, steps, `Comparison:` type, DB checks
  (queries by name, never raw secrets/data), saved baseline values for `before-after`, reproduction
  notes for known failures, coverage, uncovered areas, and residual risks, and the re-run command /
  Playwright spec path.
- Index it in `.domain-agent/index.md` under `## QA Suites` so "re-run the <feature> QA" routes
  instantly.
- `.domain-agent/qa/nav-map.md`: the one shared navigation map (entry/auth, routes, popups/new tabs,
  selectors, `screen -> API`) - one per repo, not per suite. Load it before driving; if the site has
  drifted, correct the touched rows (`reference/qa.md` "Navigation map").
- Same rules as the domain pack: read-only repo write, gitignored path, no secrets/tokens/PII/raw rows.

On a repeatable Playwright spec, save it to `.domain-agent/qa/<suite>/<flow>.spec.ts` (first run may be
hand-driven; a re-check proposes the spec per `reference/qa.md` "Repeatable script").

A `before-after` re-run must check the saved baseline is still valid: confirm its capture date and that
the schema/contract it asserts has not moved since; if it has, re-derive the baseline before diffing so
a stale baseline does not read as a regression (or a real regression as a pass).

## Gate

`bash templates/qa-only-gate.sh <vault> <browser|cli>` exits 0 only when: `report.md` carries the
required anchor headings; the underlying `qa-gate.sh` browser/CLI evidence passes; `action_count <=
action_cap` in `state.json`; and, if a DB was used, a `DB:` line marks it read-only and no write verb
(INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/DROP/ALTER/TRUNCATE) appears in the recorded DB commands. Never edit the gate to
pass.

## Dispatch

Two separate read-only subagents keep concerns (and PII) isolated. In broad QA, there may be multiple
`qa-auditor` instances, but the types stay separate:

- `qa-auditor` (`agents/qa-auditor.md`): drives the running app; screenshots/dumps stay in its context.
- `db-reader` (`agents/db-reader.md`): reads the DB read-only; raw rows/secrets stay in its context.

For broad QA, split the Impact Matrix into **Scenario shards** when the shards are independent enough to
run without shared mutable state: direct feature flow, adjacent surface, role/permission, displayed-data
propagation, viewport/a11y, error/retry, and env/A-B arms are common shard boundaries. Prefer one
`qa-auditor` per high-priority shard, plus `db-reader` for source-of-truth values. Do not shard when the
sequence is inherently ordered, when one scenario mutates state needed by the next, or when test data is
too scarce to isolate.

Use the vault as the common communication surface:

- `qa/scenario-ledger.md`: the shared ledger owned by the conductor. It contains the Impact Matrix,
  shard list, owner, status, action count, evidence path, covered/uncovered result, and residual risk.
- `qa/shards/<shard-id>.md`: one file per QA subagent. The subagent writes only its own shard file and
  evidence under `qa/`; it never edits another shard or the shared ledger directly.

The conductor merges shard summaries into `qa/scenario-ledger.md`, `verification.md`, and `report.md`.
This keeps parallel agents isolated while still giving the run one shared source of truth.

Handoff is conductor-mediated through the vault, never agent-to-agent. For `data-integrity`, `db-reader`
writes a small sanitized `qa/expected.md` (a `field -> expected value` table for the fields under test —
no raw rows, no secrets, no PII); the conductor reads it and injects those small values into `qa-auditor`,
which diffs them against the UI. **Auth/credentials are the exception: handed off transiently in the
`qa-auditor` prompt, never written to any file.** For `ab`/`env`/dataset diffs with no UI, `db-reader`
returns the diff directly. The conductor receives only the two compressed summaries and assembles
`report.md`. Never drive the browser or DB from the conductor.

`qa/expected.md` does double duty: the handoff now, and the saved **baseline** a `before-after` re-run
diffs against later (it travels into the persisted suite).

## Stop conditions

- Target not reachable: report it; do not build product code to conjure one.
- A finding needs a code fix: report it as a finding and recommend switching to DEBUG/LEGACY; do not
  edit product code.
- DB only reachable with a write-capable account: still issue read-only statements only; never write.
- DB truth is load-bearing but access is missing/skipped/unsafe: record `DB evidence: Not covered` under
  `## Not covered`, with the blocker and residual risk.
- Action cap hit: stop, report done + remaining, ask before spending a fresh budget.
- DB credentials or PII would land in a saved file: redact; never persist secrets or raw rows.
- Complex or adjacent scenario cannot be exercised safely: record it under `## Not covered` with the
  concrete blocker and residual risk.
