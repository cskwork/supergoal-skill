# About

One objective -> smallest correct change -> verified against ground truth. If invoked, run this skill's
contract instead of downgrading to an inline shortcut. `SKILL.md` is the router; `reference/` carries procedure.

**Standing rules (read first, every mode).** Before classifying the mode, read
`.supergoal/rules/RULES.md` if present. Honor it across phases as top-priority preference, but rules never
weaken safety gates. Create/edit it only when the user explicitly asks (`reference/rules.md`).

## Core principles

- Ground truth beats proxy: re-run REAL tests, re-read request/docs, and do not optimize to self-grading.
- Exact proof beats review; implementation is delegated to a builder subagent.
- Smallest correct change; match surrounding code. Scope-minimalism governs code surface area, not UI
  quality: polished user-facing UI is baseline correctness.
- GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY code changes use Before/After Eval before Build: prove before, target after, and delta with trusted commands (`reference/delivery-gate.md`).
- Ask only when genuinely ambiguous; resolve code-answerable questions by reading the code.
- Docs language: for persistent repo docs (`docs/**`, run vaults, `.domain-agent/**`, ADR/spec/changelog), match the target repo's dominant prose language; mixed/none -> the user's language. Keep identifiers, paths, commands, and machine-checked anchors in canonical English so checks keep matching.
- Hard stops: a destructive or irreversible step (drop data, force-push, external publish) needs explicit consent; if the real tests cannot pass, report it - never fake a pass.

## Run isolation (GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY that edits code)

After mode detection, resolve the source/base branch and target/integration branch (repo policy, else
ask). Verify both refs before mutating files, then create a run worktree from the source/base branch. Do
all code work there. Do not mutate the original checkout. Commit or merge only into the verified
target/integration branch after verification and user acceptance. Commit is hard-gated by the Commit gate
(`reference/delivery-gate.md`, backstop `templates/commit-gate.sh`): non-green means fix/ask, never commit
on assumption. Full contract: `reference/role-loop.md`.

## Mode (classify, state it in one line)

| Signal in the objective | Mode | Route |
|---|---|---|
| build / make / ship a new app/tool | GREENFIELD | default loop; broad/foggy builds first use a `wayfinder/` Frontier Map inside the run vault, then deliver one selected frontier ticket |
| fix / broken / failing / crash / why does | DEBUG | default loop; observe live symptom, then failing-test repro (`reference/debugging.md`, driver persona `agents/debugger.md`); web: `reference/qa.md`, `reference/playwright-cli.md` |
| add / integrate / refactor existing code | LEGACY | default loop; map first (`agents/explore.md`, `reference/domain-context.md`); optional DB evidence (`reference/db-access.md`); existing API: capture its exact behavior first as a preserve-baseline; shared code/state changes: characterization baseline (`reference/qa.md`) |
| spec / requirements first / break down / tickets / roadmap / big vague effort / frontier / what should we do first | WAYFINDER | map the destination, optional ticket-depth requirements, ticket graph, blockers, and next frontier; no product code by default (`reference/wayfinder.md`) |
| prototype / spike / try variants / prove approach before build | PROTOTYPE | throwaway proof that answers one question, then delete/quarantine or route to delivery (`reference/prototype.md`) |
| explain / teach / how does X work (no code) | TEACH | stateful `teach/<topic>/` workspace (`reference/teach.md`); lessons must pass `node templates/teach-lesson-gate.mjs` |
| learn / onboard / map this codebase (persist a wiki) | LEARN-DOMAIN | Survey -> Map -> Ground -> Onboard a `.domain-agent/` wiki (`reference/learn-domain.md`; gate `learn-grounding-gate.mjs`) |
| QA / verify / 검증만 / compare data (no code) | QA-ONLY | Impact Matrix QA (`reference/qa-only.md`; gate `templates/qa-only-gate.sh`) |
| review / audit this code/diff/PR (no fixes) | REVIEW-ONLY | `reference/review-only.md` |
| improve the architecture / find refactoring opportunities / 구조 개선 | ARCHITECTURE | friction survey -> candidates -> grill the pick -> route to LEGACY/WAYFINDER (`reference/arch.md`) |
| test harness/skill effectiveness / with vs without / does the skill help / measure skill lift | HARNESS-EVAL | `reference/harness-eval.md` |
| turn repeated work into a reusable skill | SKILL-MINE | `reference/skill-mine.md` |

The no-code/utility/planning modes - **QA-ONLY**, REVIEW-ONLY, ARCHITECTURE, WAYFINDER, PROTOTYPE, TEACH,
LEARN-DOMAIN, HARNESS-EVAL, SKILL-MINE - write no product code by default and confirm before installing
anything. PROTOTYPE may write throwaway sandbox code; it cannot ship until routed back through delivery.

**UI/UX overlay (any mode shipping user-facing UI).** Load `reference/ui-ux.md` at Frame; apply the
Expressive/polished baseline by default (`reference/taste-skill-v2.md` is the authority for ALL
user-facing UI), through Build and Verify. GREENFIELD frontend: always; LEGACY: only new UI (else reuse
the existing design system); non-visual work (lib, API, backend, CLI): skip.

**Board overlay (optional).** If the live dashboard is enabled, the conductor calls `sg-emit` at each
phase transition; it observes only, never gates (`reference/observability.md`).

## Default loop (GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY) - verification-first, subagent-default

Work runs in fresh-context subagents by default; the dispatching agent is the conductor. When the user
invokes `supergoal` for GREENFIELD, DEBUG, or LEGACY work, that invocation is explicit authorization
to use the role-loop subagents. Do not ask a second "may I spawn agents?" question unless the user
limited delegation, tooling is unavailable, or a safety/permission gate requires consent. Parallelize
independent QA shards/review dimensions. Implementation/debug/legacy runs require red-green, plus DB
evidence when persisted data is load-bearing. Full contract: `reference/role-loop.md`.

Mandatory core: Build -> Improve full spec -> Improve edge cases -> Mandatory Adversarial Review ->
Exact Verify/QA. Historical contract string: Build -> Improve full spec -> Improve edge cases -> Final
Verify. Critic/Fixer is not part of the default loop; the mandatory adversarial review is. Use optional
Critic/Fixer only when hidden requirements are the value being tested.

1. **Frame.** Write `GOAL.md` FIRST from `templates/GOAL.md`: `## Original Request` (user prompt
   verbatim), refined `## Spec`, falsifiable `## Success Criteria` checkboxes each naming its
   verification, and web apps' `## QA Cases`. GREENFIELD broad/foggy build requests use
   `reference/wayfinder.md` as an internal scope gate: preserve the destination in
   `wayfinder/map.md`, write vertical tickets under `wayfinder/tickets/`, select one frontier ticket,
   and carry only that ticket's acceptance checks into the delivery `GOAL.md` / `PLAN.md`. Write a
   completion promise in `PLAN.md` `## Intent`:
   outcome, proof, stop condition, `max_iterations` (default 8). Ask <=5 high-leverage questions only
   when needed; confirm wide/destructive/behavior-changing blast radius after grounding
   (`reference/interview.md`); deep requirements interviews may dispatch `agents/analyst.md`, and
   architecture calls `agents/architect.md`. UI: load `reference/ui-ux.md`. Code-mode runs: create `QA.md` and
   `run-state.json` from templates and record the Before/After Eval. Freeze `PLAN.md` (self-sufficient:
   steps, tools & skills, verification strategy), then clear the plan approval gate - interactive:
   the user's explicit OK; autonomous run: auto-approved, recorded in `## Approval`.
2. **Build.** Implementation runs in a separate fresh-context builder subagent briefed by the approved
   `PLAN.md` alone (on an R-LOOP re-entry, also the latest `R-LOOP.md` section). Smallest
   correct change, test-first, surrounding style. Bug: failing test first (`reference/debugging.md`).
   Shared code/state changes: capture neighbor characterization baseline before editing.
3. **Improve full spec.** Fresh-context improver re-reads the request/ticket, README, design/API docs,
   `GOAL.md` `## Success Criteria`, code, tests, and repo/data rules; fix the smallest gap between those
   requirements and current behavior.
   Production/source-code domain ambiguity that changes behavior stops as `ask-user`; generic no-user
   coding ambiguity uses a conservative, reversible default and records it.
4. **Improve edge cases.** Separate fresh-context improver attacks degenerate values, error/recovery,
   state/protocol, concurrency, compatibility, security, and cleanup. Test only grounded `must` behavior;
   route product/domain choices to the user.
5. **Mandatory Adversarial Review (no src edits).** Fresh reviewer re-reads request/docs,
   `GOAL.md`, `PLAN.md`, `QA.md`, current diff, and tests to disprove completeness. Findings become fixes,
   decision gates, or residual risk; reviewer approval alone never means done.
6. **Exact Verify/QA.** Re-run REAL tests plus the proof layer promised in Frame. Runtime-facing or
   user-expected proof: run the actual E2E/live/API/browser run; exact verification outranks reviewer
   approval. Browser UI: complete browser app verification with `qa-gate.sh <vault> browser`. Diff the
   implementer's changes against `GOAL.md` and tick each criterion proven met; re-run neighbor baselines,
   keep `Backward-trace: clean`, and record results as plain checklist sentences in `QA.md`. Criteria
   still unmet: append a timestamped checklist section to `R-LOOP.md` and relaunch the implementer
   (reads `PLAN.md` + latest section; capped by `max_iterations`). If the exact layer
   cannot run, mark it not proven with blocker/residual risk. Every `GOAL.md` box checked: write
   `Z-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` (run branch + completion timestamp) - never earlier.
7. **Critic escalation (opt-in; no src edits).** For under-specified / latent-correctness work, an
   independent critic classifies inferred behavior as `must`, `should`, or `ask-user`; only grounded
   `must` becomes FAILING tests. Append each as an unchecked `(surfaced: ...)` criterion to the run
   vault's `GOAL.md`; fixer clears reds
   without editing tests. Ambiguous/product-changing semantics are decision gates, not generated REDs.
   Reserve for the under-specified frontier and keep within the critic->fixer cap.
