# /supergoal - baseline-first

One objective -> the smallest correct change -> verified against ground truth. Trivial single edit: skip
this skill and edit directly. This file is a router; each phase loads only the reference it needs.

**Standing rules (read first, every mode).** Before classifying the mode, read `.supergoal/rules/RULES.md`
in the project if present and honor it across all phases as the top-priority preferences - but rules never
weaken safety gates. Create or edit it only when the user explicitly asks (`reference/rules.md`).

## Core principles

- Verify against ground truth: re-run the project's REAL tests and re-read the prose spec for rules the
  tests miss; never optimize to a self-graded proxy.
- Smallest correct change; match surrounding code; never rewrite a whole file for a few lines.
  Scope-minimalism governs code surface area, NOT visual quality: for user-facing UI a polished result is
  baseline correctness, not padding.
- Default to forced whole-spec verification: after Build, re-read every stated-or-implied requirement
  (each input's degenerate values null/undefined/empty/boundary, error/edge paths) and fix the smallest
  gap even when the visible tests pass. Opt-in escalation for under-specified / latent-correctness work:
  an independent critic that did not write the code turns the unstated requirements into FAILING tests.
- For non-trivial code changes, run a Before/After Eval before Build: prove the before state, the after
  target, and the delta with trusted repo/evaluator commands (`reference/delivery-gate.md`).
- Ask only when genuinely ambiguous; resolve code-answerable questions by reading the code.
- Docs language: for persistent repo docs (`docs/**`, run vaults, `.domain-agent/**`, ADR/spec/changelog),
  match the target repo's dominant prose language; mixed or none -> the user's language. Keep identifiers,
  paths, commands, and machine-checked anchors in canonical English so checks keep matching.
- Hard stops: a destructive or irreversible step (drop data, force-push, external publish) needs explicit
  consent; if the real tests cannot pass, report it - never fake a pass.

## Run isolation (GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY that edits code)

Right after mode detection, resolve the source/base branch and target/integration branch (repo policy,
else ask). Verify both refs before mutating files, then create a run worktree from the source/base branch
and do all work there. Do not mutate the original checkout. Commit or merge only into the verified
target/integration branch after verification and user acceptance. Commit is hard-gated by the Commit gate
(`reference/delivery-gate.md`, backstop `templates/commit-gate.sh`): a non-green run does not commit -
resolve it in the loop or ask the user about the requirement, never commit on an assumption. Full contract:
`reference/role-loop.md`.

## IntentGate (classify before routing, state it in one line)

Before the mode table, write: `IntentGate: intent=<work kind>; confidence=<high|medium|low>;
mode=<route>; capability_refs=<refs/tools needed>`. Category is the work kind; capability refs are the
skill files/tools to load after routing. High confidence -> route immediately. Medium confidence -> route
to the safest narrow mode and name the uncertainty. Low confidence or conflicting intent -> ask one
blocking question. Do not load a heavy reference just to classify.

Near-miss rule: if the words mention a capability but the real task is no-code, route to the no-code mode
first (QA-ONLY/REVIEW-ONLY/TEACH/LEARN/HARNESS-EVAL/SKILL-MINE). If the user asks to edit code, route to
GREENFIELD/DEBUG/LEGACY only after the edit target is clear.

## Mode (classify, state it in one line)

| Signal in the objective | Mode | Route |
|---|---|---|
| build / make / ship a new app/tool | GREENFIELD | default loop |
| fix / broken / failing / crash / why does | DEBUG | default loop; observe the live symptom boundary first, then reproduce with a failing test (`reference/debugging.md`); web: `reference/qa.md`, `reference/playwright-cli.md` |
| add / integrate / refactor existing code | LEGACY | default loop; map first (`agents/explore.md`, `reference/domain-context.md`); optional DB evidence (`reference/db-access.md`); existing-API refactor: capture its exact behavior first as a preserve-baseline (`reference/qa.md`) |
| spec / requirements first / 스펙 문서로 구조화 | SPEC | spec-first prefix: requirements -> design -> tasks under `docs/spec/`, then tasks drive Build (`reference/spec.md`) |
| explain / teach / how does X work (no code) | TEACH | stateful `teach/<topic>/` workspace (`reference/teach.md`); lessons must pass `teach-lesson-gate.mjs` |
| learn / onboard / map this codebase (persist a wiki) | LEARN-DOMAIN | Survey -> Map -> Ground -> Onboard a `.domain-agent/` wiki (`reference/learn-domain.md`; gate `learn-grounding-gate.mjs`) |
| QA / verify / 검증만 / compare data (no code) | QA-ONLY | Impact Matrix QA (`reference/qa-only.md`; gate `templates/qa-only-gate.sh`) |
| review / audit this code/diff/PR (no fixes) | REVIEW-ONLY | `reference/review-only.md` |
| improve the architecture / find refactoring opportunities / 구조 개선 | ARCHITECTURE | friction survey -> candidates -> grill the pick -> route to LEGACY/SPEC (`reference/arch.md`) |
| test harness/skill effectiveness / with vs without / does the skill help / measure skill lift | HARNESS-EVAL | `reference/harness-eval.md` |
| turn repeated work into a reusable skill | SKILL-MINE | `reference/skill-mine.md` |

The no-code/utility modes - **QA-ONLY**, REVIEW-ONLY, ARCHITECTURE, TEACH, LEARN-DOMAIN, HARNESS-EVAL,
SKILL-MINE - write no product code by default and confirm before installing anything.

**UI/UX overlay (any mode shipping user-facing UI).** Load `reference/ui-ux.md` at Frame; apply the
Expressive/polished baseline by default (`reference/taste-skill-v2.md` is the authority for ALL
user-facing UI), through Build and Verify. GREENFIELD frontend: always; LEGACY: only new UI (else reuse
the existing design system); non-visual work (lib, API, backend, CLI): skip.

**Board overlay (optional).** If the live dashboard is enabled, the conductor calls `sg-emit` at each
phase transition; it observes only, never gates (`reference/observability.md`).

## Default loop (GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY) - verification-first, subagent-default

Work runs in fresh-context subagents by default (the dispatching agent is the "conductor"); a trivial
single edit skips the loop and edits inline. Independent units (QA scenario shards, review dimensions) run
in parallel. Difficulty gate: *very easy* -> skip; harder -> red-green is REQUIRED, plus DB evidence when
persisted data is load-bearing. The mandatory core is Build -> Forced Verify; the independent-critic
escalation is opt-in (a measured lever for under-specified work, not always on). Full contract:
`reference/role-loop.md`.

1. **Frame.** Restate goal + falsifiable acceptance criteria in one line. Write a completion promise:
   the promised outcome, required proof, stop condition, and `max_iterations` (default 8). If underspecified, ask <=5
   high-leverage questions; and once the approach is grounded, if the fix's blast radius reaches past
   its target, confirm it before Build - tiered, hard-gated when wide/destructive/behavior-changing
   (`reference/interview.md`). Resolve code-answerable questions by reading code. UI work: load
   `reference/ui-ux.md` now. Non-trivial code work: start `delivery-proof.md` from
   `templates/delivery-proof.md`, create `run-state.json` from `templates/run-state.json`, and record
   the Before/After Eval (`reference/delivery-gate.md`).
2. **Build.** Smallest correct change, test-first; match surrounding style; minimal diff. Bug: reproduce
   with a failing test first (`reference/debugging.md`).
3. **Forced Verify vs ground truth (mandatory core).** Re-read the WHOLE prose spec from scratch and, for
   every stated-or-implied behavior - especially each input's degenerate values (null/undefined/empty/
   boundary) and error/edge paths - confirm the code is correct and fix the smallest gap, even when the
   visible tests are green (they are not the spec). Re-run the project's REAL tests and loop Build->Verify
   until no fresh gap appears. Browser UI: complete browser app verification with
   `qa-gate.sh <vault> browser` (lint, typecheck, build, and screenshots do not substitute). Data
   load-bearing past *very easy*: DB evidence too. Stop on green only after updating `delivery-proof.md`
   with after evidence, resolved decision gates, and residual risk; report what was verified, with
   command output.
4. **Critic escalation (opt-in; independent, no src edits).** For under-specified / latent-correctness
   work - where the lever is surfacing requirements ABSENT from the prompt - escalate to an independent
   critic that did not write the code: re-read the prose spec + repo/data rules
   (`reference/domain-context.md`, `domain-rules.md`), write a FAILING test for each missed required
   behavior, and log it in the run vault's `surfaced-requirements.md`; a fixer then clears the reds (no
   test edits). A signal, not the oracle. Measured caveat: on explicit-spec tasks this role separation did
   NOT beat equal-compute forced verification, so reserve it for the under-specified frontier. For wide
   under-specified plans, run a bounded adversarial plan attack before Build: security, scope, correctness,
   performance, and operability critics may attack the plan, but only accepted required risks become tests
   or decision gates.

Roles -> personas: critic=`agents/code-reviewer.md`, fixer=`agents/executor.md`,
verify=`agents/qa-auditor.md`/`security-reviewer.md` (others in `agents/<role>.md`).

| `reference/observability.md`, `tui/` | Board: opt-in live dashboard |

**Done =** mode stated; smallest diff in surrounding style; Before/After Eval complete for non-trivial
code changes; REAL tests + prose spec green (not a proxy) - a runtime MUST is proven only by exercising its real behavior, never by a test that just checks a method was called or re-asserts current behavior;
past *very easy* -> red-green test + DB evidence if data load-bearing; user-facing UI at the Expressive
baseline; destructive steps consented; commit/merge only after the commit gate passes
(`reference/delivery-gate.md`); report what was verified with command output.
