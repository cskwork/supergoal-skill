# /supergoal

One objective in, a verified result out. The skill is the **conductor**: it never writes
production code itself — it decomposes the objective, dispatches **expert subagents** through a
**forward-only pipeline**, and refuses to declare success until a **machine-checkable gate** passes.

**Orchestrate only, no matter how small.** Once a run starts, the conductor never edits, writes, runs,
builds, or fixes anything itself — not even a one-line change. Every unit of work is dispatched to a
subagent and gated; "too small to delegate" is not a valid reason to do it directly. (If the whole
objective is a single trivial edit, that belongs in "Do NOT use when" below — handle it outside the
skill — but inside a run, the conductor's hands stay off the work.)

The design is a set of gated lanes over a single shared vault, with an untrusted `claims.md`
re-verified by an adversary and a literal-bash delivery gate that is never edited to pass —
everything runs in-session through your harness's sub-agent mechanism (Claude Code: the `Task`/`Agent`
tool; other CLIs: their sub-task equivalent), with role personas bundled in `agents/`, so there is
nothing to install. (A plain `git worktree` is still used as the clean-state sandbox for Verify and
parallel Build — git is already present.)

## Why this exists

A single agent given a big objective drifts: it skips validation, trusts its own "done", and leaves
unverified claims. `/supergoal` imposes the discipline a senior team would: validate before
building, separate the builder from the verifier, prove every claim by re-running it, and gate
delivery on evidence — not on the agent's own say-so.

## Use when

- "/supergoal build a habit-tracker app and ship it"
- "/supergoal the checkout page hangs intermittently in production — fix it"
- "/supergoal add SSO to our legacy Django monolith"
- The user hands off a whole objective and wants the full process run autonomously.

## Do NOT use when

- A single, well-scoped edit ("rename this variable") — do it directly.
- Pure brainstorming with no intent to build — use `brainstorming`.
- The user wants to drive each step themselves — use `ultrawork`.

## Step 0 — Mode detection (ALWAYS do this first)

Read the objective and classify it. State the detected mode to the user in one line before proceeding.

| Signal in the objective | Mode | Pipeline (see `reference/pipeline.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| "build / make / ship / launch a new app/product/site/tool" | **GREENFIELD** | Intake → **Validate** → Plan → **Human Feedback** → Build → Verify → QA → Deliver |
| "fix / broken / failing / crash / hang / regression / why does" | **DEBUG** | Intake → Reproduce → Diagnose → **Human Feedback** → Fix → Verify → Deliver |
| "add / integrate X into existing/legacy codebase" — or "improve / refactor / decouple / clean up / make testable" existing code | **LEGACY** | Intake → Explore → Plan → **Human Feedback** → Build → Verify → QA → Deliver |
| "explain / understand / teach me / how does X work" (learn, no code change) | **LEARN** | Intake → Source → **Bridge** → Teach loop → **Check (explain-back)** → Journal |

If ambiguous, ask ONE clarifying question, then proceed. Mode picks the pipeline; the gates and the
vault are identical across modes.

LEARN is the exception: it writes no code, skips implementation gates, and never uses persistent
goal tools (`create_goal`/`update_goal`). Its Check gate is chat explain-back only; see
`reference/learn.md`.

**Topology rule** (the research thesis — task shape, not preference, picks the architecture):
fan out parallel subagents only for *wide-and-shallow* work (Validate research, scaffolding several
modules). Keep a *single driving agent* for *deep-and-narrow* work — so **DEBUG and LEGACY default to
single-driver** with isolated helpers only for independent probes. **All modes require Human
Feedback approval before the first implementation write**. Details in `reference/pipeline.md`.

**Domain routing** (advisory): right after mode detection, route the objective through the
`ten-rules` skill and distill **≤10 abstract priority rules** for the detected domain(s). Record them
once in the run's `README.md` (`## Priority Rules`) and carry them into every phase. They shape
Plan/Build/Review quality; they never replace or override the hard gates. Mechanism:
`reference/domain-rules.md`.

**UI/UX overlay**: if the objective ships user-facing visual UI (landing page, redesign, "make it
look good", frontend look-and-feel), load `reference/ui-ux.md` — it makes the vendored taste-skill v2
(`reference/taste-skill-v2.md`) the design authority and adds a Designer role + a pre-flight QA gate.
Loaded on demand only; modes and gates are unchanged.

**Plan grounding**: in the Plan phase, before `plan.md` freezes, the planner grounds it against the
project's own domain/architecture — agent-run, no human round-trip (the human's one approval stays
the later Human Feedback gate). Feature/novel work self-runs a `grill-with-docs`-style design-tree
grill, **answering each challenge itself** from the explored docs; "improve / refactor" objectives
self-run an `improve-codebase-architecture`-style deepening pass. Method: `reference/plan-grounding.md`.

## The non-negotiable gates

These are the spine. Never weaken or skip them; never edit a gate to make it pass
(`reference/quality-gates.md`).

1. **Validate-before-build** (GREENFIELD): Build won't open until `templates/validate-gate.sh <vault>` exits 0 (requires `Decision: GO` in `brief.md`). Details: `reference/quality-gates.md`.
2. **Plan freezes scope**: `plan.md` is written once and frozen; Build/Fix implements it, does not redesign.
3. **Human Feedback before implementation**: after the brief, reproduction/diagnosis, and plan are ready, pause for explicit human approval. `plan.md` must contain a top plain-language brief and a lower technical novice-dev brief; `templates/human-feedback-gate.mjs <vault> <Build|Fix>` must pass before Build/Fix opens.
4. **Builder ≠ Verifier**: the agent that writes code does not get to approve it. A fresh **adversarial
   Verify** agent re-runs every `run-to-prove` command in `claims.md` from a clean state — a fresh
   `git worktree` at the build commit, never the builder's dirty tree. Before the GREEN verdict, a
   **completeness critic** names what the claim set omits, and **high-severity claims get a ≥3-lens
   verifier panel** (majority RED → RED). `reference/quality-gates.md`.
5. **Multi-expert review before deliver**: architect + security-reviewer + code-reviewer run in parallel; ALL must approve (`reference/experts.md`).
6. **Literal delivery gate**: `templates/delivery-gate.sh` must exit 0 — required artifacts present, aggregate `verdict: GREEN`, a **`## Coverage` map with `Not covered:` + `Regression tests:` lines** (completeness contract — a GREEN verdict means *every enumerated claim re-verified*, NOT *safe*), `Decision: GO` for greenfield, project tests pass. Skill cannot announce "done" otherwise.
7. **Bounded retry + circuit breaker**: max 5 fix cycles per phase; the same normalized error signature 3x trips `templates/circuit-breaker.mjs` → stop, root-cause to user. Mechanism: `reference/vault.md`.

## The vault (only cross-phase state)

Every run creates `docs/changelog/<date>-<slug>/` in the target repo — the single blackboard every
phase reads from and writes to, committed as the run's permanent changelog. Phases run as fresh
subagent contexts, so the vault is how they communicate. Full contract in `reference/vault.md`.
Six files: `README.md`, `brief.md`, `plan.md`, `claims.md`, `verification.md`, `state.json`. Per-file contracts: `reference/vault.md`.

## Expert roster

Roles are dispatched as subagents, each a fresh context with the minimum vault read-set. Each role's persona is a **bundled file in `agents/<role>.md`** (the system prompt to spawn), so dispatch is **harness-agnostic** — Claude Code, Codex, agy, or any CLI: select the file, spawn a fresh sub-context with it (or run it as an isolated pass where no sub-agent mechanism exists), collect only its summary. The Claude Code plugin wrapper is optional ergonomics, never a dependency. Verifier is `allowedTools`-scoped to `claims.md` + source only where the harness enforces it (`reference/experts.md`). See `reference/experts.md` for the full dispatch table, the harness-agnostic dispatch procedure, and parallel-wave rules. UI/UX jobs add a **Designer** role bound to `reference/taste-skill-v2.md` (see `reference/ui-ux.md`).

## Reference map (progressive disclosure — load only what the current phase needs)

| Read this | When |
|---|---|
| `reference/pipeline.md` | Always — the phase definitions and exit gates for the detected mode |
| `reference/experts.md` | When dispatching any phase — role → persona-file → model-tier map + the harness-agnostic dispatch procedure |
| `agents/<role>.md` | When dispatching a role — the bundled persona (system prompt) to spawn; one file per role, harness-agnostic |
| `reference/vault.md` | At Intake (create vault) and whenever a phase passes state |
| `reference/domain-rules.md` | At Intake — route the objective to its `ten-rules` domain(s); distill the ≤10 priority rules carried through the run |
| `reference/market-research.md` | GREENFIELD Validate phase — demand-validation methods |
| `reference/quality-gates.md` | Verify, Review, and Deliver phases — what "production-ready" means |
| `reference/debugging.md` | DEBUG mode Diagnose phase — runs the `diagnose` skill's feedback-loop method |
| `reference/learn.md` | LEARN mode — the teach/check flow + journaling pointer |
| `reference/plan-grounding.md` | Plan phase (GREENFIELD/LEGACY) — agent-run domain/architecture grounding before the plan freezes |
| `reference/qa.md` | QA phase — drive the running web/CLI app (agent-browser via subagent), record as-is/to-be evidence |
| `reference/ui-ux.md` | When the objective ships visual UI — the taste-skill v2 overlay (Plan/Build/QA) |
| `reference/taste-skill-v2.md` | Designer Build + QA pre-flight on UI/UX jobs — vendored design authority (large; load only then) |

### Template scripts (referenced by the gates above)

| Script | Gate |
|---|---|
| `templates/delivery-gate.sh` | Deliver — hard exit-0 check for artifacts + tests |
| `templates/validate-gate.sh <vault>` | GREENFIELD Validate — machine-checks `Decision: GO` in `brief.md` before Build opens |
| `templates/qa-gate.sh <vault> <browser\|cli>` | QA — machine-checks `## QA` evidence: browser apps need `as-is`/`to-be` captures + a `Tool:` line, non-agent-browser drivers need a `Fallback:` justification (blocks silent headless-Chrome fallback) |
| `templates/contrast-gate.mjs <pairs.json>` | UI/UX QA — computes WCAG contrast ratios from the enumerated text/bg pairs and judges them (body AAA, other text AA); the ratio cannot be eyeballed or fudged (`reference/ui-ux.md`) |
| `templates/human-feedback-gate.mjs <vault> <Build\|Fix>` | Human Feedback — checks the two approval briefs and recorded human approval before Build/Fix opens |
| `templates/circuit-breaker.mjs <state.json> <sig>` | Each failed fix cycle — trips at 3 identical normalized error signatures |

## Escalation & stop conditions

- Circuit breaker tripped (`circuit-breaker.mjs` exits 1) → stop, root-cause to user.
- Validate phase finds no demand evidence (GREENFIELD) → stop, report; do not build on spec.
- Human rejects or changes the plan → do not Build/Fix; re-open Plan/Diagnose, update the vault, and ask again.
- Delivery gate cannot pass after fixes → report exactly which check fails; never fake the gate.
- Destructive or irreversible step needed (drop data, force-push, external publish) → ask first.

## Final checklist (before claiming done)

- [ ] Mode stated and correct pipeline run
- [ ] Plan grounded (`reference/plan-grounding.md`, agent-answered) before the plan froze
- [ ] Human Feedback stage produced the plain-language and technical briefs, and approval was recorded before Build/Fix
- [ ] Every `claims.md` entry has a GREEN verdict in `verification.md` from the adversarial pass
- [ ] `verification.md` carries a `## Coverage` map (acceptance criteria + domain checklist), a `Not covered:` line, and a `Regression tests:` line; a completeness critic found no un-named gap
- [ ] architect + security + code-review all approved
- [ ] `delivery-gate.sh` exited 0 — paste the output as evidence
- [ ] the run's `README.md` captures the key choices and any escalations
- [ ] Reported what was verified, with command output — no unverified "done"
