# /supergoal literal delivery gate.
# The orchestrator may NOT announce "done" unless this exits 0.
# NEVER edit this script to make a failing run pass — fix the work instead.
#
# Usage: delivery-gate.sh <vault-dir> [test-command]
#   <vault-dir>     the run's changelog folder, e.g. docs/changelog/2026-05-30-my-objective
#   [test-command]  optional; if omitted, auto-detected from the project
#
# Exit 0 only if: required vault artifacts exist, verification is GREEN with no RED,
# the verification enumerates its coverage and names its gaps (completeness contract),
# and the project's own test/build suite passes in this workspace.
#
# Verdict semantics: `verdict: GREEN` means "every ENUMERATED claim + coverage item re-verified",
# NOT "the code is safe". A gate is only as complete as the claim set behind it — so the
# completeness contract below forces that set to be enumerated and its gaps named, rather than
# letting an incomplete verification pass silently (the false-GREEN failure mode).
