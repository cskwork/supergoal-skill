# /supergoal QA gate — the literal exit condition for the QA phase (GREENFIELD/LEGACY,
# and any web-bug check in DEBUG). It converts "QA actually drove the app with agent-browser
# and captured user-observable evidence" from prose (reference/qa.md) into a machine-checkable
# backstop. QA was the one phase gate that stayed instruction-only, which let a run silently
# fall back to a headless-Chrome render, skip the as-is/to-be proof, and still pass delivery.
# NEVER edit this script to make a non-compliant QA pass — re-run QA properly instead.
#
# Usage: qa-gate.sh <vault-dir> <browser|cli>
#   <vault-dir>  the run's changelog folder, e.g. docs/changelog/2026-06/10-my-objective
#   browser|cli  app type under test: a browser app (drives a real browser) or a CLI/library
#
# Exit 0 only if:
#   browser: verification.md has a '## QA' section; qa/as-is-* and qa/to-be-* evidence files
#            exist (the user-observable proof, same framing); the '## QA' section records
#            `agent-browser doctor`; the driver is named on a 'Tool:' line; and if that driver
#            is NOT agent-browser, a 'Fallback:' line justifies why agent-browser was impossible
#            (a silent headless-Chrome fallback fails here).
#   cli:     verification.md has a '## QA' section recording an integration smoke (no browser
#            evidence required — CLI/library has no browser).
