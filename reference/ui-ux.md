# UI/UX overlay - design authority

Load whenever the objective ships user-facing UI. The **Expressive/polished baseline is the default for
ALL user-facing UI** - `reference/taste-skill-v2.md` is always the authority. There is no separate
"Functional" tier you classify down into that ships a plainer result. Pure non-visual work (lib, API, CLI
without TUI) loads neither.

| Surface | Authority |
|---|---|
| ANY user-facing UI - landing, portfolio, app, tool, dashboard, form, "make X" | **Expressive baseline** - `reference/taste-skill-v2.md` (always) |
| ...AND the surface is dense admin/dashboard/data-table | + `reference/functional-ui.md` density add-on, layered on top |

`reference/functional-ui.md` is NOT an alternative to Expressive and never lowers polish - it only adds
density discipline (type/spacing/density scale) and complete UI states (loading/empty/error/disabled) on
top of the Expressive baseline for information-dense surfaces. Marketing aesthetic (hero imagery, heavy
motion) is dialed down for dense surfaces via the Plan dials below, not by skipping design authority. A
mixed product still applies the Expressive baseline everywhere and adds the density layer only to its
dense surfaces. The rest of this file describes the Expressive authority.

The chosen authority overlays the normal mode; phases, gates, vault, and topology stay unchanged. UI
scaffolding may fan out, but one surface's look-and-feel is deep-and-narrow: use one Designer driver
per surface.

| Phase | Overlay |
|---|---|
| Plan | Add one-line **Design Read** and dials `DESIGN_VARIANCE`, `MOTION_INTENSITY`, `VISUAL_DENSITY` to `plan.md`. Pick official design system vs aesthetic. If the Design Read vibe names a specialized aesthetic, also pick at most ONE **aesthetic family** from `reference/taste-aesthetics.md` (selection map there) and record it on the Design Read line; no family signal means base taste-skill-v2 alone. For known brands, use existing brand color/type as accent source and record it. |
| Build | Dispatch **Designer** with `plan.md` + `reference/taste-skill-v2.md` + (if a family was chosen) its profile from `reference/taste-aesthetics.md`. Enforce anti-default rules, real/generated images, reduced-motion fallback, hard visual bans, locked accent, no off-brand gradient/glow slop, and no self-approval. With a family: commit to that one, apply its bans; the family overrides base aesthetic defaults where they conflict, base universal rules still hold. |
| QA | Run taste Pre-Flight beside normal QA, plus the chosen family's Pre-Flight delta. Required: a11y, reduced motion, Color Consistency Lock, LILA rule, dark/light or justified single-mode lock. Record `UI-tier: Expressive` (and the family, if any) in `verification.md` `## QA` and enumerate every text/bg pair to `<vault>/qa/contrast-pairs.json`; `qa-gate.sh` runs `node templates/contrast-gate.mjs` on it (completeness critic audits the pair list). Any fail rewinds to Build and blocks Deliver. |

Progressive disclosure:

- Conductor does not load `taste-skill-v2.md` into its own context.
- Plan Architect loads only the sections needed for Design Read/dials/system choice.
- Build Designer loads the full file in its own context, plus the one selected family profile from `taste-aesthetics.md` if the Plan chose one.
- Verify + committee still gate Deliver.

## Source note

`reference/taste-skill-v2.md` is a compressed derivative of the upstream taste-skill v2 source, with
source and commit preserved in its banner. Refresh by re-pulling upstream, then re-compress if context
cost still matters.

`reference/taste-aesthetics.md` holds the optional Expressive aesthetic families (minimalist-ui,
high-end-visual-design, industrial-brutalist-ui), compressed from upstream's specialized sub-skills with
their own source/commit banner. Loaded only when the Plan selects a family.
