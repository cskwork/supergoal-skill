# LEARN mode — teach the user, don't change code

For "explain X" / "understand Y" / "teach me Z" — a codebase area or a general concept. No production code is written. **Done = the user can define every key term and explain the idea back, unaided.** Not "I explained it."

LEARN skips Validate/Build/Verify/QA/Deliver and the implementation gates. It runs its own flow and journals to `learn/`.

## Flow

`Intake -> Preference -> Source -> Bridge -> Teach loop -> Check -> Journal`

0. **Preference (first thing in any LEARN run).** Before sourcing, load the user's preference profile from `USER_PREFERENCE.md` in the skill dir (`<skill>/USER_PREFERENCE.md`; see "User preference profile" below). It holds two things: the **difficulty level** (1-10, default 5) and the **1-3 interests**.
   - **Has a profile** → use the difficulty level and interests silently; do **not** re-ask.
   - **Missing or empty** → create it from the template (difficulty defaults to **5**), then ask the user in ONE short message to name their **1-3 main interests** (hobbies, work field, a game/sport/domain they love). Save the answer to `USER_PREFERENCE.md`, then continue the flow.
   - **Difficulty drives register; interests drive analogies.** Pitch every turn at the saved level (see "Difficulty ladder"); draw the analogy/example from an interest.
   - **Difficulty updates automatically** when the user tunes it (see "Difficulty tuning"); **interests update on request only**. Otherwise the profile persists across sessions and topics ("고정").
   - Carry the profile into **Bridge** (build the analogy from an interest) and the **Teach loop** (pitch at the difficulty level; where the topic allows, draw the worked example from an interest too).
1. **Source.** Gather before teaching; no guessing.
   - Codebase topic: dispatch `explore`/`architect` (read-only) to map files, symbols, and the call flow.
   - General concept: research authoritative sources.
2. **Bridge (mandatory).** Ask what the user already knows (one calibration question). Connect the unfamiliar domain to *their* language/world with one concrete analogy — **draw it from an interest in `USER_PREFERENCE.md`** (step 0) so the bridge lands in a world the user already inhabits. The bridge sits directly under the terms table (see Output format) and frames every definition. Rule: a term may lead, but only with a **plain-language definition** — never a jargon-first definition that needs other jargon to parse.
3. **Teach loop** — Feynman + Socratic, run via the `grill-me` skill. The FIRST teaching turn opens with the **Output format** below (terms on top), then proceeds question-driven:
   - **Pitch every turn at the saved difficulty level** (see "Difficulty ladder") — the level sets vocabulary, term count, and depth; the structure stays the same.
   - Lead with the clearly-defined key-terms table, then why-it-matters, then the simple flow, then one example.
   - Explain in plain words. Every term in the table has a beginner-friendly definition the user could repeat.
   - Don't lecture — after the opening frame, ask back. One question at a time; follow each branch of the decision tree until that node is resolved.
   - The user's answers expose gaps; fill them, then re-ask. Deliberately defer deep edge-cases — name them under "later" instead of teaching them now.
   - **End every teaching turn with the difficulty-tuning menu** (see "Difficulty tuning"); a bare `1`/`2`/`3` reply re-tunes the level instead of answering the lesson.
4. **Check (the gate).** The user restates each key term and the whole idea in their own words, unaided. Gaps -> return to step 3. Mastered only when they pass — this is LEARN's delivery gate.
5. **Journal (live, during the session).** Append to `learn/<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md` as you go: the question, the bridge/analogy, key terms + plain definitions, the user's own explanation, open questions. Create `learn/` if missing. Format: `learn/README.md`.

## Output format (the opening teaching turn — terms on top)

The first teaching turn MUST follow this structure, in the user's language. Key terms come **first**, defined in beginner-friendly words. Render it as:

[비유 한 줄 — 위 용어들을 사용자의 세계로 잇는 다리]

이 주제를 왜 쓰는지: [현실에서 어디에 쓰이는지, 어떤 문제를 푸는지]

핵심 흐름: `A → B → C`

예를 들어: [현실적인 예시 하나]

이것만 기억하면 된다: [한 문장 핵심 정리]

(지금은 건너뛰는 것: [나중에 배울, 지금 들어가면 헷갈리는 내용])

---
난이도 (지금 5/10): 1 더 쉽게 · 2 적당함(기본) · 3 더 어렵게
```

Structural rules:
- **~5 key terms at level 5** — a beginner can't hold more at once; the Difficulty ladder raises this at higher levels and cuts it at lower ones. Extra terms go under "지금은 건너뛰는 것".
- Each definition is pitched at the saved level — at level 5, "초보자가 이해할 수 있는 말", not a dictionary definition. If a definition needs another jargon word, that word is also a row or it gets rewritten.
- Short, clear sentences. No term appears in prose before it appears in the table.
- End every opening turn with ONE question back to the user (the Socratic loop), not more explanation — then the difficulty-tuning menu line (see "Difficulty tuning"), rendered in the user's language with the current level filled in.

## Difficulty ladder (1-10, default 5)

The saved level sets the **register** of every teaching turn — vocabulary, sentence length, how many terms, how much depth, how mature the analogy. Same topic, different altitude.

| Level | Audience | Register |
|---|---|---|
| 1-2 | 막 말을 뗀 아이 | Tiny sentences. ~3 terms max, each a single everyday word. Pure concrete analogy, zero jargon. |
| 3-4 | 입문자 | Plain words, ~4 terms, one concrete analogy. No assumed background. |
| **5 (default)** | 일반 성인 비전공자 | The terms-on-top format as written: ~5 plain-defined terms, why-it-matters, simple flow, one example. |
| 6-7 | 해당 분야 초중급자 | Standard terminology allowed (still defined). More terms (~7), real mechanics, a second example. |
| 8-9 | 실무자 / 숙련자 | Precise technical vocabulary, fewer hand-holds, edge cases and trade-offs included. |
| 10 | 박사 / 전문가 | Full rigor and formal precision. Assume deep background; engage the hard cases, name the literature. |

The Output format and term cap above describe **level 5**. As the level rises, raise the term ceiling and the precision; as it falls, cut terms and shorten sentences. The structure (terms first, then why, flow, example, one-line takeaway) holds at every level — only the altitude changes.

## Difficulty tuning (end every teaching turn with it)

Every teaching turn ends with a one-line tuning menu, **in the user's language**, with the current level filled in:

```
난이도 (지금 5/10): 1 더 쉽게 · 2 적당함(기본) · 3 더 어렵게
```

- **A bare single-number reply (`1` / `2` / `3`) is a tuning signal, not an answer to the lesson.**
  - `1` → level **− 1** (easier)
  - `2` → **no change** (just right; also the default if the user simply continues without a number)
  - `3` → level **+ 1** (harder)
- Clamp to **[1, 10]**. At the floor or ceiling, say so ("이미 가장 쉬운/어려운 단계예요") and hold.
- On any change: **rewrite the `## Difficulty` value in `USER_PREFERENCE.md`**, confirm in one short line ("난이도 4로 낮췄어요"), then **immediately re-pitch the same content at the new level** — don't wait for the next topic.
- A reply that is clearly an answer to the lesson (anything other than a bare 1/2/3) is treated as content, not tuning.

## User preference profile (`USER_PREFERENCE.md`)

A persistent, cross-session file at `<skill>/USER_PREFERENCE.md` — the single place LEARN keeps what it knows about the user. It holds two things:
- **Difficulty** (1-10, default 5) — the altitude every teaching turn is pitched at (see "Difficulty ladder").
- **Interests** (1-3) — so analogies and examples land in a world the user already knows; the same concept taught through *their* hobby sticks far better than a generic one.

The repo ships **`USER_PREFERENCE.template.md`** (the empty placeholder, committed). The real `USER_PREFERENCE.md` holds personal data, so it is **git-ignored** — never committed to the public repo. On first run, if `USER_PREFERENCE.md` is missing, seed it from the template (difficulty 5) and fill the interests from the user's answer.

- **Read it at step 0 of every LEARN run.** Only ask the user if it is missing or empty.
- **Persistent ("고정").** One profile serves all topics and projects. Do not re-ask each session.
- **Difficulty updates automatically** on a tuning signal (see "Difficulty tuning"); **interests update only on user request** (e.g. "관심사 바꿔줘 / add X"). Either way, rewrite the file and confirm in one line.
- **Use, don't announce.** Pull an interest to shape the analogy/example; don't lecture about the profile itself.

# User preference profile

Updated: YYYY-MM-DD

## Difficulty

## Interests (1-3, ordered by strength)
1. <interest> — <one phrase: what about it, so analogies can hook in>
2. ...
3. ...

<optional: tone, what landed well, analogies to avoid>
```

## Principles (the tutor contract)

1. Don't flood with jargon up front. Terms appear only in the table, each with a plain definition.
2. Lead with why the topic exists and where it's used in the real world — before mechanics.
3. Show the whole shape as a simple flow (A → B → C) before any detail.
4. Use an analogy — apt, not childish. Bridge to the user's own world.
5. Cap the must-know terms at ~5.
6. Define each term in beginner words, never dictionary-style.
7. Deliberately omit confusing depth; park it as "later."
8. Short, clear sentences. (Render in the user's language.)
9. Always include one realistic example.
10. Close with a single "이것만 기억하면 된다" line.
11. Anchor the analogy — and, where the topic allows, the worked example — in an interest from `USER_PREFERENCE.md`. Teach the concept through the user's own world, not a generic one.
12. Pitch every turn at the saved difficulty level (1-10, default 5), and close every turn with the tuning menu — a bare `1`/`2`/`3` lowers, holds, or raises the level and rewrites `USER_PREFERENCE.md`.

- A term is "known" only when the user can define it back in plain language.
- Serve both audiences: a non-technical user gets analogies from their own domain; a technical user gets analogies from systems they already know.
- Never dump a lecture. After the opening frame, the loop is question-driven.
