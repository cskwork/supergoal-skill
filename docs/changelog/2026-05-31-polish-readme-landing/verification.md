# Verification

Assembled by the orchestrator from two independent, fresh-context agents (builder != verifier):
the adversarial **Verifier** (read-scope: `claims.md` + the three source files only; re-ran every
`run-to-prove` from a clean state) and the **completeness critic** (read-scope: `brief.md` coverage list
+ source; never `claims.md`). Verdicts originate from those agents; the orchestrator only transcribes.

## Per-claim verdicts (adversarial re-run from clean state)

claim s1-s3-landing: GREEN — re-ran the node dash+parity proof on `docs/index.html`: printed `en=114 ko=114`, exit 0; independent scan for `[—–]` returned `none` (zero U+2014/U+2013 anywhere, incl. title/meta/gatebar/footer). `--faint` is `#8593a1` (old `#6b7884` absent); `@media(prefers-reduced-motion:reduce)` present; `a:focus-visible,.btn:focus-visible` rule present (not only toggle buttons). Tag balance intact (span 159/159, div 111/111, p 44/44, pre 5/5, section 7/7). Zero external requests (`<link>`/`<script src>`/`@import`/`url(` all 0). EN/KO show-hide rules + toggle + A-/A+ JS intact.
claim s4-readme: GREEN — node proof exits 0 (zero `[—–]`). TL;DR summary present in the first 6 lines; `harness-audit` substring absent; all 6 relative links resolve on disk; factual spot-checks ("68 tests", mode names, gate names) match `SKILL.md` + `docs/index.html`.
claim s5-uiux-doc: GREEN — the added clarification in `reference/ui-ux.md` names both the Plan Architect (taste sections 0-2) and the Build Designer (full file), stating the conductor never loads `taste-skill-v2.md` itself.

## Surgical-diff + no-regression
- `git status --porcelain` / `git diff --stat`: the only changed TRACKED files are `README.md`, `docs/index.html`, `reference/ui-ux.md` (104 ins / 97 del). Untracked: this run's vault folder + `grep.exe.stackdump`. Nothing staged; the stackdump is NOT staged.
- Project suite: `RESULT: 51 passed, 0 failed` (`tests/gate-scenarios.test.sh` from a clean LF `git archive HEAD` export, run under WSL with `NODE_OPTIONS=--test-reporter=tap`). Caveat: this exercises the gate scripts + committed example vaults via the HEAD export; the three doc edits in this run touch no suite-tested code, so a green HEAD-export suite is a valid no-regression signal for a docs-only change.

## Coverage
- AC1 (HTML validity / self-contained): single `<!doctype html>`, all block tags balanced, zero external requests (inline `<style>`+`<script>` only), node-parseable — GREEN
- AC2 (bilingual parity): `.en` = 114, `.ko` = 114 (exact); `html[lang] .en/.ko{display:none}` rules + toggle + A-/A+ JS intact; no language leak — GREEN
- AC3 (accessibility WCAG-AA): `--faint` `#6b7884`->`#8593a1` (4.33:1->6.23:1 on bg, 4.05:1->5.82:1 on cards); `a:focus-visible,.btn:focus-visible` ring added (reuses `--acc2`) covering all interactive controls; `prefers-reduced-motion` neutralizes smooth-scroll; gate bar/controls keep `role`/`aria-label`/`aria-pressed` — GREEN
- AC4 (responsive 320/375/768/1040): `.wrap` 1040 + padding; grids collapse at 820px; gate bar degrades at 720/600/480px; `.flow`/`.diagram` scroll inside `overflow-x:auto`; dash edits touched no width/media logic — GREEN (320px gate-bar packing reasoned, not yet rendered — see QA)
- AC5 (hierarchy & polish): all sizes from existing tokens / `--fs`; only token VALUE change is `--faint`; no ad-hoc one-off values added — GREEN
- AC6 (performance): no late assets (zero external requests); net file growth trivial, well under +25% — GREEN
- AC7 (TL;DR first): README lines 3-6 = a 4-line scannable summary before the prose; landing link prominent — GREEN (no literal "TL;DR" label; the summary serves the purpose — cosmetic)
- AC8 (hierarchy & scan): one H1, sections H2; tables/lists carry structure; landing link prominent at top + callout — GREEN
- AC9 (accuracy/sync): conductor/gates/roster/modes + proof numbers (68 tests, 43 green, 2 SSRF, unauth-500, lost-update race, 2-of-3) match README <-> landing <-> SKILL.md — GREEN
- AC10 (no broken links): all 6 README relative links resolve; landing's 1 relative href resolves — GREEN
- AC13 (conductor-load clarification): `reference/ui-ux.md` line added stating the conductor never loads `taste-skill-v2.md`; Plan Architect loads sections 0-2, Build Designer loads full file; SKILL.md left unchanged (permitted) — GREEN
- AC14 (no regressions): suite 51/51 (above); no skill logic/gate/template touched — GREEN
- AC15 (surgical diff): only the three declared tracked files + this run's vault changed; no SKILL.md edit, no churn elsewhere — GREEN
- Domain checklist — WCAG-AA contrast / visible focus on all controls / prefers-reduced-motion / bilingual parity+no-leak / zero external requests / valid HTML5 / README link integrity / content accuracy-sync / surgical diff / no-regression: all GREEN (responsive at exact widths pending a live render — QA).

Not covered: AC11/AC12 do not exist in the brief (numbering jumps 10->13) — nothing to verify. A live browser render at the four exact viewport widths was NOT executed by the Verify agents (static CSS reasoning only); the single residual risk it leaves (320px gate-bar horizontal packing) is carried to QA. Actual execution of `tests/gate-scenarios.test.sh` was performed by the Verifier (51/51), not by the critic.
High-risk fixed RED: none
Regression tests: none (verify-only docs run — the edited files are landing/README/reference markup+HTML, not code under `tests/`; no permanent test added or needed).

## Named gaps (adversarial completeness hunt — disposition)
1. `reference/ui-ux.md` is NOT dash-clean and the run's added line uses `§0–§2` (en-dash). DISPOSITION: by design — the dash-ban scope is the user-facing landing page + README (AC2/3, S3/S4); `ui-ux.md` is an internal reference doc never rendered to users, and the en-dash matches the file's existing section-range convention (`§0–§1`, line 15). Not a defect; named so it is not later mistaken for a regression.
2. 320px gate-bar packing is reasoned, not rendered. DISPOSITION: carried to QA — render at 320/375/768/1040px and confirm no horizontal overflow (this risk pre-exists the change; the dash edit was on the `.g` span that is `display:none` below 720px).
3. Stray untracked `grep.exe.stackdump` in repo root (msys-grep crash debris). DISPOSITION: delete before commit; it is untracked and unstaged, so a surgical `git add` of the three files + vault excludes it.

## QA
Taste-skill v2 Pre-Flight Check (Section 14) + a11y + prefers-reduced-motion, run by a fresh QA agent against `docs/index.html` and three headless-Chrome renders (320/768/1040px, Korean mode) saved in `qa/`.
- Pre-Flight: 46 of 47 applicable boxes PASS; 15 N/A (React/Tailwind/GSAP/Motion/design-system/forms/bento/logo-wall boxes inapplicable to a static single-file dark landing). Confirmed: zero em-dashes; page theme lock (one dark theme); color + shape consistency; button contrast (AA); no duplicate CTA intent; copy self-audit clean (EN+KO, no broken/hallucinated strings); no AI tells (green/blue accent not AI-purple, no div-based fake screenshots); reduced-motion wrapped; mobile collapse explicit; no scroll cues / version footers / locale strips.
- a11y: body/dim/faint text clears WCAG-AA on the dark bg (`--faint` now `#8593a1`); `:focus-visible` on ALL interactive controls (links, `.btn`, language toggle, A-/A+); `prefers-reduced-motion` honored; gate-bar controls carry `role`/`aria-label`/`aria-pressed`; `<html lang>` updates on toggle.
- Responsive: no horizontal overflow at any achievable width (`scrollWidth < innerWidth`: 467<482, 735<750, 1007<1022). Headless Chrome enforces a ~500px minimum window so a literal 320px viewport could not be forced; below 480px the media query sheds the `.mono` label, so the gate bar fits more easily, hence no overflow at 320px by measurement + monotonic reasoning. The clipped controls in `render-320.png` are a 320px-canvas-over-482px-layout screenshot artifact, not a real overflow.
- The ONE non-passing box, "Hero stack discipline" (hero has 5 text elements + 4 in-page nav buttons vs the rule's max 4 text + 2 CTAs), is recorded as a JUSTIFIED, HUMAN-APPROVED EXCEPTION: the rule is a contextual anti-bloat heuristic for newly-generated marketing heroes; this hero is pre-existing and well-composed (not bloated), its four buttons are in-page section-nav anchors, and satisfying the rule would require a hero restructure that conflicts with the explicit "refine in place / preserve content" mandate and exceeds the approved plan. The human explicitly chose to keep the hero as-is (2026-05-31). Not worsened by this run (the run only removed em-dashes + a11y/spacing within the existing structure).

QA: PASS (Pre-Flight clean except the one documented, human-approved Hero-stack exception; a11y clean; no visual defect; no regression).

verdict: GREEN
