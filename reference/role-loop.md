# ROLE-LOOP - the default loop for GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY

Use for any non-trivial GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY feature, bug, or refactor. Trivial single edit: edit
directly.

The mandatory core is Build -> Improve full spec -> Improve edge cases -> Final Verify. After Build, one
fresh-context improver re-reads the whole spec; another attacks edge cases; Final Verify tries to disprove
the result with real evidence. Critic/Fixer is not part of the default loop.

Use it when the task is under-specified, latent-correctness-heavy, security/edge/domain-rule-sensitive, or
Final Verify exposes an unexplained requirement gap. Do not use it when the spec is explicit, behavior is
already stated, the harness is single-process/context-limited, or the eval compares equal-compute vanilla
unless critic/fixer is the tested lever. Critic/Fixer is optional gated escalation: a critic classifies
inferred behavior, then a fixer clears accepted reds. Production/domain behavior-changing ambiguity needs
user feedback. Generic no-user coding ambiguity uses the most conservative, reversible default and
records the choice.

## Run setup - before any file mutation

For any non-trivial GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY code edit, first resolve the source/base branch and
target/integration branch. Prefer repo policy or user-provided refs; ask if either is ambiguous. Then
verify both refs exist and create a branch-scoped run worktree:

```bash
git worktree add -b <run_branch> <worktree_path> <source/base branch>
```

Run Build, Improve, optional Critic/Fixer, Final Verify/QA, tests, and vault writes inside that worktree;
never edit the original checkout. Treat dirty original-checkout files as user work. Commit or merge only
into the verified target/integration branch after green verification, user acceptance, and only once the
commit gate passes (`reference/delivery-gate.md`; `bash templates/commit-gate.sh <vault> <browser|cli|none>`).
Non-green blocks commit: resolve in-loop; escalate only when stuck.

Before any file mutation, create the run vault's `delivery-proof.md` from
`templates/delivery-proof.md`, create `run-state.json` from `templates/run-state.json`, and start the
Before/After Eval (`reference/delivery-gate.md`):

- record eval intent: user goal, constraints, tradeoffs, rejected approaches;
- seed `## Requirement Trace` with numbered requirements in the user's words;
- record the completion promise: promised outcome, required proof, stop condition, and `max_iterations`
  (default 8);
- record the before state: absent feature/red acceptance check for GREENFIELD, reproduced symptom for
  DEBUG, preserve-baseline capture for LEGACY/brownfield, plus neighbor characterization baseline for any
  shared code/state change past *very easy*;
- DEBUG first tries exact live reproduction. If exact reproduction is unavailable, preserve the
  failure-triggering properties in synthetic/similar data and fill `## Reproduction Fidelity` with
  fidelity level, data source, prod-vs-test deltas, residual risk, and post-deploy confirmation plan;
- record the after target and command manifest from repo-owned or evaluator-owned proof commands.
- keep `run-state.json` current: phase, iteration, unresolved gates, blockers, next action,
  regression_ledger, last proof command.

## Completion promise + loop cap

Frame writes the completion promise before Build. Loop only while the promise is unproven and a fresh,
actionable gap remains. Default `max_iterations`: 8 for Build/Verify; critic->fixer cap below. At cap,
write forced reflection in `run-state.json`: failing check, likely root cause, unproven requirement,
previous-green regression status, smallest next action. Each iteration re-runs `regression_ledger`; if a
previously green check turns red, stop, fix it, and record
`forced_reflection.regressed_previously_green`. Ask only for requirement-level blockers or consent.

## Roles (each role = a fresh-context subagent by default)

Dispatch by default: conductor runs each role as a fresh-context subagent so heavy references load inside
that role, not the conductor. Return short structured status only: changed files, proof output, concerns.
Parallelize independent units; order dependent roles. Build (1), Improve full spec (2), Improve edge
cases (3), and Final Verify (4) are mandatory. Critic/Fixer is optional gated escalation, usually after
the edge pass or when Final Verify finds an unexplained gap.

0. **Adversarial plan attack (conditional, no src edits)** - only for under-specified, wide-blast-radius,
   security/data/concurrency, or latent-correctness work. Before Build, dispatch critics for security,
   scope, correctness, performance, and operability. Accept only findings grounded in prose spec, current
   code/data, or platform rules; convert required risks into tests, decision gates, or residual risk.

1. **Build** - before first edit, confirm blast-radius beyond the explicit target (`reference/interview.md`).
   Then smallest correct change; match surrounding style. Bug: failing test first. For any shared
   code/state change past *very easy*, capture a neighbor characterization baseline FIRST
   (`reference/qa.md` "Characterization baseline"). Refactor/integrate an existing API: capture its
   exact-behavior baseline FIRST. Capture run setup in `delivery-proof.md` and `run-state.json`.

2. **Improve full spec** (`agents/executor.md`; fresh-context improver)
   - Re-read the FULL prose spec, current code, existing tests, `## Requirement Trace`, and repo/data
     rules. Confirm every stated-or-implied behavior; fix the smallest full-spec gap.
   - If production/source-code domain ambiguity would change user-visible behavior, data semantics,
     permissions, migrations, or API compatibility, stop and record an `ask-user` decision gate. Do not
     guess business meaning.
   - Generic no-user coding utility/eval fixture: choose the most conservative, reversible default,
     record the choice in `delivery-proof.md`, and prefer preserving existing values/no-op behavior unless
     spec or safety requires strictness.
   - Add or adjust tests only for grounded `must` behavior. Do not turn silence into stricter semantics.

3. **Improve edge cases** (`agents/executor.md`; fresh-context improver)
   - Attack degenerate inputs, missing/extra fields, duplicates, ordering, idempotency, error/recovery,
     state/protocol transitions, concurrency, compatibility, security side effects, resource cleanup.
   - For each gap, apply the same threshold: production/domain behavior-changing ambiguity needs user
     feedback; generic no-user coding ambiguity gets a conservative, reversible default and a recorded
     rationale.
   - Re-run the targeted tests after every fix. Keep the diff minimal; no padding, rewrites, or unrelated
     cleanup.

4. **Final Verify/QA vs ground truth (mandatory core)** (`agents/qa-auditor.md` / `security-reviewer.md`)
   - Fresh-context adversarial verify: re-read the FULL prose spec and try to disprove the change against
     stated requirements, implied `must` behavior, edge cases, and execution evidence. Re-run REAL tests
     and report output. Fresh gap -> route back to Improve full spec or Improve edge cases.
   - Code-change scenarios use `reference/qa.md` "Scenario stencil (code changes)", including regression
     scenarios and metamorphic relations when no exact oracle exists.
   - Browser UI changes require `reference/qa.md` browser evidence: `Tool: playwright-cli`,
     fixed-route as-is/to-be captures, and passing `bash templates/qa-gate.sh <vault> browser`.
   - Re-run every captured neighbor characterization baseline; unnamed drift is red. API refactor:
     re-capture the same call and diff against the pre-refactor baseline; unintended drift is a red to
     resolve.
   - Close `## Requirement Trace`: every forward row is `met` with a verifying check, and
     `Backward-trace: clean` proves no diff hunk is orphan scope.
   - Final Verify for neighbor baselines and trace closure is fresh-context: self-review is not a
     regression gate. Open requirements, unresolved REVISE items, and stub/placeholder implementations
     block done.
   - Update the run vault's `surfaced-requirements.md`: mark each surfaced requirement fixed, or note why
     it stays open.
   - Update `delivery-proof.md`: after evidence, outputs/artifact paths, decision gates, intentional
     drift, residual risk. Unresolved `ask-user` findings or missing trusted commands block a final done
     claim and commit (`reference/delivery-gate.md` Commit gate).
   - Update `run-state.json`: phase, iteration, gate status, last proof command, blockers, next action,
     and completion-promise status.

5. **Critic** (`agents/code-reviewer.md`; OPT-IN escalation for under-specified / latent-correctness work) - DO NOT edit src or weaken/delete existing tests.
   - Re-read prose spec and repo/data rules. Enumerate REQUIRED behaviors existing tests miss, especially
     boundary inputs, error/recovery, scoping/precedence, filters, incremental update, concurrency,
     protocol/state.
   - Requirement threshold: classify each candidate as `must`, `should`, or `ask-user`. Only `must`
     requirements grounded in the prose spec, current/API behavior, repo/data rules, or platform safety
     get failing tests. Do not turn silence into stricter semantics (for example throwing on degenerate
     inputs) when multiple reasonable behaviors exist; record that as an `ask-user` decision gate or
     residual risk.
   - For each `must`, write a NEW FAILING black-box/property test in a separate file, derived strictly
     from the spec.
   - Record each surfaced requirement in the run vault's `surfaced-requirements.md`
     (`docs/changelog/<YYYY-MM>/<DD-topic>/surfaced-requirements.md`; create if absent; format in
     `templates/surfaced-requirements.md`): dated heading, one bullet per `must` - what the spec implies,
     why it is required though the prompt never stated it, and the failing test that now covers it
     (status: open).
   - Leave the failing tests red.

6. **Fixer** (`agents/executor.md`) - DO NOT edit test files.
   - Read NOTES + run the suite. Make the failing tests pass with the SMALLEST change.
   - If a critic-authored test appears to encode an `ask-user` choice, contradict current/API behavior, or
     harden semantics not required by the spec or safety, stop and report the decision gate instead of
     optimizing source to it.
   - No padding: add no code that is not required by a failing test or a listed defect. Do not break
     passing tests.

The improve-pass core is mandatory except *very easy* issues. Past that: whole-spec improve, edge-case
improve, REAL tests, and DB evidence for data-backed bugs (`reference/db-access.md`). DB proves data
state; it does not replace red-green. Loop the opt-in critic->fixer escalation only while a fresh red
appears.

Board (optional): if enabled (`reference/observability.md`), conductor may call `sg-emit --phase <P>` at
phase transitions (Frame/Build/ImproveFullSpec/ImproveEdgeCases/Critic/Fixer/Verify/Done). Opt-in,
best-effort; observes only, never blocks or gates the loop.

## Guardrails (keep it baseline-first, not Goodhart)

- Generated tests are a SIGNAL to surface hidden requirements, not the oracle. Final verification is REAL
  tests + prose spec. Never weaken/delete a real test; never declare done because self-written tests pass.
- Ambiguous edges are not REDs. If a production/domain behavior change has multiple reasonable meanings,
  classify it as `ask-user` or residual risk; do not invent stricter semantics. If generic/no-user, choose
  a conservative, reversible default and record it.
- Characterization baseline is a regression signal, not a correctness oracle. A known-bug snapshot changes
  only when the bug fix is intentional and named.
- Self-review is not a regression gate: generated explanations can approve behavior drift. Require
  execution evidence, fresh-context verification, and no stub done claims.
- Derive every generated test from the prose spec, not from a guessed rubric; a wrong generated test the
  fixer optimizes to is the failure mode - keep them black-box and spec-anchored.
- Stop condition: cap the Build->Verify loop at `max_iterations` (default 8) with forced reflection, and
  cap the critic->fixer loop at 3 cycles; if a 4th critic cycle would start, escalate to the user with
  the open reds instead of grinding. Doubt-theater anti-signal: 2+ cycles that produce findings but
  change no code means the critic is validating, not doubting - stop and recut the critic's spec focus.
