# Changelog 2026-06-03

## LEARN Atom Map and Process Trace Enforcement

### Decision

Make LEARN explanations visibly decompose knowledge into an atom map, plain definitions, a process
trace, and only then the composed explanation.

Added `tests/learn-contract.test.sh` so future edits keep the atom-role table, process-trace table,
low-difficulty trace requirement, and glossary-only rejection in place.

### Reasoning

Definitions alone do not explain behavior. The stricter contract forces each lesson to show what
the pieces are, what role each piece plays, and what happens step by step, including decision points,
side effects, and fallback/stop rows when they exist.

## Domain Context Overlay

- Added `reference/domain-context.md` so `supergoal` can keep domain expertise separate from the run
  vault and model memory.
- Added `templates/domain-agent/` as the repo-local knowledge scaffold for first-run setup.
- Default storage is `.domain-agent/` at the target repo root, ignored by default through `.gitignore`
  before local knowledge is written.
- The contract keeps current code as the source of truth: saved domain knowledge routes exploration,
  but Plan must verify load-bearing facts against current docs/code.
- Added a freshness policy so future packs use light refresh after 5 days, full review after 30 days,
  and triggered refresh on stale evidence instead of full-pack refresh on every run.

## LEARN Human-to-Code Bridge

### Decision

Add a Human-to-Code bridge to LEARN mode for coding, algorithm, and codebase-mechanics lessons:
`human words -> tiny worked example -> explicit rules -> state/variables -> flow/code -> trace`.

`reference/learn.md` now requires a short "사람 생각 -> 기계 단계" bridge before code appears, and
defines the bridge as a two-column teaching tool that scales by difficulty level.

### Reasoning

The existing LEARN mode already handled terms, difficulty, interests, and explain-back, but it could
still jump too quickly from an intuitive explanation to code or system mechanics. The
`human-to-code-translation-skill` pattern is easier to follow because it makes the missing middle step
visible: what a person does naturally must become explicit state, rules, flow, and traceable cases
before it becomes code.

This change is LEARN-only. It does not alter build/debug/legacy gates, worktree isolation, or delivery
verification.

## Worktree Contract Test Anchors Restored

### Decision

Restore the explicit branch-scoped worktree wording required by `tests/worktree-contract.test.sh` in
`SKILL.md`, `reference/pipeline.md`, and `reference/experts.md`.

### Reasoning

The LEARN change did not touch worktree behavior, but verification exposed that earlier wording
compression removed three contract-anchor phrases. The test is intentionally literal because
branch-scoped isolation prevents multiple agents from editing the same checkout and keeps Build/Fix
writers inside the run worktree.

## Completed Run Worktree Retention

### Decision

Change the post-acceptance worktree policy from remove-after-merge to repo-scoped retention:
`supergoal` keeps the three most recent completed run worktrees and prunes only the oldest
repo-managed completed run worktree when the retained count exceeds three.

### Reasoning

Retained worktrees preserve recent run context for review and follow-up. The cap prevents unbounded
local checkout growth, and the repo-managed boundary avoids deleting the active run worktree, original
checkout, or manual worktrees.

## Agent-Only Skill Entrypoint Compression

### Decision

Compress `SKILL.md` into a thin agent contract: core invariants, mode routing, worktree setup,
gates, vault, dispatch, and reference map.

### Reasoning

Only agents need to operate this file. Detailed explanations already live in `reference/` and gate
scripts, so the entrypoint should route behavior with minimal prose while preserving literal contract
anchors for tests.

## Plan Grounding Pressure Test

### Decision

Fold design-tree pressure-test behavior into `supergoal` Plan grounding and the domain-agent
template:

- Walk a design tree by dependencies, one branch at a time.
- Answer questions from current docs/code before asking the human.
- Challenge vague or conflicting terminology against selected knowledge, current repo docs when
  present, and the domain-agent glossary.
- Stress decisions with concrete normal, boundary, failure, and ownership scenarios.
- Save glossary and decision knowledge only after it is resolved and useful for future routing.

### Reasoning

The fallback contract did not spell out terminology pressure, scenario pressure, code contradiction
checks, and the bar for durable decisions. The domain-agent template now carries those rules so
first-run knowledge packs avoid becoming generic implementation notes.

## Branch Ref Verification Before Worktree

### Decision

Require coding/debug/legacy runs to resolve the target repository first, ask for the source branch
and target branch unless both are explicit, and verify both refs in that repo before creating the run
worktree. Missing refs now stop the run and ask for corrected source/target branch names instead of
guessing from nearby branches.

### Reasoning

The previous wording required base/target collection but did not force repo-local ref verification
before worktree creation. In a multi-repo checkout, a branch name can exist at the umbrella root while
being absent in the actual target repo. The new check prevents wasted `git worktree add` attempts and
keeps branch choice explicit.
