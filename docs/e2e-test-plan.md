# /just-do-it — full E2E test plan

Purpose: prove the skill drives an objective through its gated pipeline correctly in all three modes,
that **every gate actually gates**, that the vault is produced correctly at
`docs/changelog/<date-slug>/` (6 files), and that failure modes (NO-GO stop, RED rewind, circuit
breaker, approval gate) behave as specified. Evidence over assertion — each test states the exact
command/observation and its pass criterion.

## 0. Preconditions

- Skill installed at `~/.claude/skills/just-do-it` (or symlinked from this repo).
- `gh` not required. Node ≥18 available (fixtures use the zero-dep `examples/url-shortener`).
- A throwaway dir per E2E run (`git init`), so nothing touches real repos. Use `mktemp -d`.
- Budget note: a full pass spawns many subagents (each mode runs analyst/architect/executor/
  verifier/committee/qa). Run tier A (unit) on every change; tiers B-F before a release.

## Test taxonomy

| Tier | What | Cost | Automatable |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | `delivery-gate.sh` unit scenarios | trivial | fully (bash) |
| B | Per-mode happy-path E2E (GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY) | high | semi (drive + inspect) |
| C | Guardrail / failure-mode tests | high | semi |
| D | Vault & artifact-layout tests | low | fully (after a B run) |
| E | Verification-adequacy tests (does Verify catch real bugs?) | med | semi |
| F | Docs/consistency lint | trivial | fully (grep) |

---

## Tier A — delivery-gate.sh unit tests (deterministic)

Run `templates/delivery-gate.sh <vault> <test-cmd>` against hand-built vault fixtures. `<test-cmd>`
is `true`/`false` to isolate gate logic from a real suite.

| # | Vault fixture | Expect |
|---|---|---|
| A1 | empty dir | FAIL "brief.md missing" |
| A2 | brief only | FAIL "plan.md missing" |
| A3 | brief+plan, no verification | FAIL "verification.md missing" |
| A4 | verification with no `verdict: GREEN` line | FAIL "no 'verdict: GREEN'" |
| A5 | verification has a line-start `verdict: RED` | FAIL "verdict: RED remains" |
| A6 | brief has `Decision: GO` + prose mentioning NO-GO | PASS |
| A7 | brief has `Decision: NO-GO` | FAIL "decision is NO-GO" |
| A8 | brief has no `Decision:` line (DEBUG/LEGACY) | PASS (validation skipped) |
| A9 | all artifacts valid + test-cmd `false` | FAIL "test suite did not pass" |
| A10 | all artifacts valid + test-cmd `true` | PASS, exit 0 |
| A11 | valid artifacts, no test-cmd, no detectable runner | FAIL "no test command…" |

Harness (paste-run):

```bash
GATE=~/.claude/skills/just-do-it/templates/delivery-gate.sh
T=$(mktemp -d); cd "$T"; mkdir v
ok(){ printf 'p\n'>v/plan.md; printf 'verdict: GREEN\n'>v/verification.md; printf 'g\n'>v/brief.md; }
run(){ bash "$GATE" ./v "${1:-true}" >/tmp/g.out 2>&1; echo "exit=$? $(grep -m1 -E 'GATE (FAIL|PASS)' /tmp/g.out)"; }
ok; printf 'g\n## Decision: GO\nNO-GO if exists\n'>v/brief.md; run true      # A6 -> PASS
ok; printf 'g\n## Decision: NO-GO\n'>v/brief.md; run true                    # A7 -> FAIL
ok; run false                                                               # A9 -> FAIL
ok; run true                                                                # A10 -> PASS
```

Pass criterion: all 11 rows match. (A6/A7/A9/A10 verified during development; the rest are quick.)

## Tier B — per-mode happy-path E2E

For each, run `/just-do-it <objective>` in a fresh `git init` dir and inspect the vault + gate output.

### B1 — GREENFIELD (ship a new app)
- Objective: `build a small CLI todo app with JSON persistence and ship it`.
- Expect: mode stated GREENFIELD; topology fans out at Validate; `docs/changelog/<date>-cli-todo*/`
  created with the 6 files; `brief.md` has a `## Validation` ending `Decision: GO`; `plan.md` frozen;
  `claims.md` has ≥1 entry with `run-to-prove`; `verification.md` ends `verdict: GREEN`; committee
  approves; **`delivery-gate.sh` exits 0** (paste output); a commit exists.
- Pass: gate exit 0 + suite green + 6-file vault present + a working `todo add/list/done`.

### B2 — DEBUG (root-cause a hard bug)
- Fixture: copy `examples/url-shortener`, apply the **lost-update fixture** (Appendix 1). The suite
  still passes (the bug is concurrency-only) — this is the realistic trap.
- Objective: `stats undercount hits on popular links under concurrent traffic — fix it`.
- Expect: mode DEBUG, single-driver; **read-only until approval** (no source edit before the
  approval line in `state.json`); Reproduce writes a *failing* concurrency test; Diagnose records
  competing hypotheses in `README.md` and the fix plan in `plan.md`; after approval, Fix; Verify
  re-runs repro GREEN + full suite + stability (no flake); gate exit 0.
- Pass: failing-before → passing-after repro; zero source edits before approval; verification GREEN.

### B3 — LEGACY (add a feature to existing code)
- Fixture: clean `examples/url-shortener`.
- Objective: `add an optional per-link click cap (max redirects) to the existing shortener`.
- Expect: mode LEGACY; Explore writes a file:line code map to `README.md`; surgical frozen `plan.md`
  with backward-compat note; approval before Build; Build matches existing style (no unrelated
  churn); Verify confirms the **pre-existing suite still passes** + new tests; gate exit 0.
- Pass: no regressions (old tests green) + new behavior tested + minimal diff.

### B4 — GREENFIELD NO-GO (the validate gate stops a bad idea)
- Objective: `build yet another generic todo app identical to the dozens that exist`.
- Expect: Validate concludes `Decision: NO-GO`; the harness **STOPS and reports**; **no Build, no
  code written**; the gate is never reached.
- Pass: zero source files created; a NO-GO rationale is produced.

---

## Tier C — guardrail / failure-mode tests

### C1 — builder ≠ verifier catches a real bug
- Inject an SSRF gap (Appendix 2) so the builder's own tests pass but an adversarial probe fails.
- Expect: Verify returns RED with the specific bypass → rewind to Build → fix → Verify GREEN.
- Pass: the bug never reaches Deliver; the rewind is recorded in `README.md`.

### C2 — circuit breaker
- Force an unfixable failure (e.g., a test that asserts an impossible postcondition).
- Expect: after the **same error 3×**, the harness STOPS, writes the root cause to `README.md`, and
  escalates to the user. No infinite loop; ≤5 cycles total.
- Pass: run terminates with an escalation, not a hang.

### C3 — frozen plan
- Mid-Build, introduce a requirement that contradicts `plan.md`.
- Expect: the change is flagged as scope drift, not silently absorbed; plan stays frozen (a re-plan
  is an explicit step, logged).
- Pass: `plan.md` unchanged during Build.

### C4 — approval gate (DEBUG/LEGACY)
- Expect: `state.json.approval` is `null` until the user approves; no file under the project's
  source tree is modified while it is `null`.
- Pass: `git status` shows no source changes before approval is recorded.

### C5 — read-scope isolation
- Inspect the dispatched Verifier subagent prompt.
- Expect: its READ set is `claims.md` + code only — never `plan.md`/`brief.md`.
- Pass: prompt contains no plan/brief content.

---

## Tier D — vault & artifact-layout tests (run after any Tier B)

- D1: vault is at `docs/changelog/<date>-<slug>/` (not `./.just-do-it/`).
- D2: exactly six files: `README.md`, `brief.md`, `plan.md`, `claims.md`, `verification.md`,
  `state.json` (no separate `validation.md`/`architecture.md`/`contracts.md`/`qa-report.md`/
  `decisions.log`).
- D3: `brief.md` contains a `## Validation` section (greenfield) ending in a `Decision:` line.
- D4: `verification.md` contains a `## QA` section (when QA ran) and a final aggregate `verdict:`.
- D5: the vault is **committed** with the code (not gitignored) — `git ls-files` lists it.

Check: `ls docs/changelog/*/` and `git ls-files docs/changelog/`.

---

## Tier E — verification adequacy ("a green suite is not proof")

- E1 — failing-before requirement: for B2/C1, confirm the new test **fails on the unfixed code** and
  passes after the fix (Verify must record this).
- E2 — suite sanity: temporarily break the implementation; the relevant test must go RED. A test
  that stays green on broken code is rejected by Verify.
- Pass: Verify explicitly demonstrates red-before / green-after, not just a final green.

---

## Tier F — docs/consistency lint (cheap, run on every change)

- F1: every file named in `SKILL.md`'s reference map exists.
- F2: no canonical skill doc references a removed vault file as a *current* artifact
  (`validation.md`/`qa-report.md`/`decisions.log`/`architecture.md`/`contracts.md` may appear only in
  migration notes). Grep: `grep -rnE '(validation|qa-report|architecture|contracts)\.md|decisions\.log' SKILL.md reference/ templates/delivery-gate.sh`.
- F3: `delivery-gate.sh` passes `bash -n` and the Tier A matrix.
- F4: landing `docs/index.html` has balanced `<section>`/`</section>` and the vault table lists the 6 files.

---

## Execution checklist

```
[ ] A  delivery-gate.sh 11/11 scenarios
[ ] B1 GREENFIELD reaches gate exit 0
[ ] B2 DEBUG: failing→passing repro, no pre-approval edits
[ ] B3 LEGACY: zero regressions, minimal diff
[ ] B4 NO-GO halts before Build
[ ] C1 adversarial Verify catches the planted bug (RED→rewind)
[ ] C2 circuit breaker terminates (no hang)
[ ] C3 frozen plan holds
[ ] C4 no source edits before approval
[ ] C5 Verifier read-scope = claims + code only
[ ] D  6-file vault at docs/changelog/<slug>/, committed
[ ] E  red-before/green-after demonstrated
[ ] F  docs lint clean
```

Overall PASS = every box checked. Any FAIL → file an issue with the exact gate output / vault diff.

## Appendix 1 — DEBUG fixture: lost-update race (reusable)

In `examples/url-shortener/src/store.js`, move the read OUTSIDE the mutex so concurrent hits lose
updates (suite still green; only a concurrency test exposes it):

```js
async function incrementHit(code) {
  ensureInit();
  const existing = links.get(code);          // <-- read hoisted out of enqueue() = the bug
  if (!existing) return null;
  return enqueue(async () => {
    const updated = Object.freeze({ ...existing, hits: existing.hits + 1 });
    links.set(code, updated);
    await persist();
    return updated;
  });
}
```
Symptom to feed DEBUG mode: "stats undercount hits on popular links under concurrent traffic."

## Appendix 2 — guardrail fixture: SSRF gap

In `src/validate.js`, drop the IPv6 / FQDN-dot handling so `http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/` and
`http://localhost./` are accepted. The builder's unit tests pass; an adversarial Verify probe of
those hosts must fail → RED → rewind. (This is the real defect the GREENFIELD live run caught.)

## Non-goals / limitations of this plan

- Tier B Validate depends on live web-search availability; offline, demand evidence is degraded
  (the gate still works, but the Validate content is weaker).
- Browser QA (Playwright/a11y) applies only to browser apps; CLI/library targets use integration
  smoke instead.
- Tiers B/C are token-heavy (many subagents) — run on releases, not every edit.
