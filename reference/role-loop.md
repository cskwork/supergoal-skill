# ROLE-LOOP - the default loop for GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY

The default loop's mandatory core is build, then FORCED VERIFICATION: re-read the WHOLE prose spec from
scratch and fix every gap - especially each input's degenerate values (null/undefined/empty/boundary)
and error/edge paths - re-running the project's REAL tests until stable, even when the visible tests are
already green. That forced whole-spec re-reading is the active ingredient that lifts correctness on
false-GREEN-prone work.

Use for any non-trivial feature/bug/refactor. Skip for a trivial single edit - edit directly. Layer an
independent critic (a reviewer that did NOT write the code, classifying inferred requirements before any
new failing tests, then a fixer that clears accepted REDs) as an OPT-IN escalation for genuinely
under-specified / latent-correctness work, where surfacing requirements absent from the prompt is the
lever. The critic classifies inferred behavior before testing it: required `must` behavior can become a
RED; ambiguous or product-changing
semantics become `ask-user` gates. Measured caveat: on explicit-spec tasks that role separation did NOT
beat equal-compute forced verification, so it is an escalation for the under-specified frontier, not an
always-on default.

## Run setup - before any file mutation

For any non-trivial GREENFIELD / DEBUG / LEGACY run that edits code, first resolve the source/base branch
and target/integration branch. Prefer repo policy or user-provided refs; if either ref is ambiguous, ask
before editing. Then verify both refs exist in the target repo and create a branch-scoped run worktree,
for example:

```bash
git worktree add -b <run_branch> <worktree_path> <source/base branch>
```

Run Build, Critic, Fixer, Verify, tests, and run-vault writes inside that worktree; never edit the
original checkout. Treat dirty files in the original checkout as user work. After green verification and
user acceptance, commit or merge only into the verified target/integration branch - and only once the
commit gate passes (`reference/delivery-gate.md`; `bash templates/commit-gate.sh <vault> <browser|cli|none>`
exits 0). A non-green run blocks the commit: resolve it in the loop first, escalate to the user only when
stuck (see stop condition below).

Before any file mutation, create the run vault's `delivery-proof.md` from
`templates/delivery-proof.md`, create `run-state.json` from `templates/run-state.json`, and start the
Before/After Eval (`reference/delivery-gate.md`):

- record eval intent: user goal, constraints, tradeoffs, and rejected approaches;
- seed `## Requirement Trace` with numbered requirements in the user's words;
- record the completion promise: promised outcome, required proof, stop condition, and `max_iterations`
  (default 8);
- record the before state: absent feature/red acceptance check for GREENFIELD, reproduced symptom for
  DEBUG, preserve-baseline capture for LEGACY/brownfield, plus neighbor characterization baseline for any
  shared code/state change past *very easy*;
- DEBUG first tries exact live reproduction. If exact reproduction is unavailable, preserve the
  failure-triggering properties in synthetic/similar data and fill `## Reproduction Fidelity` with
  fidelity level, data source, prod-vs-test deltas, residual risk, and post-deploy confirmation plan;
- record the after target and command manifest from repo-owned or evaluator-owned proof commands.
- keep `run-state.json` current after each phase with current phase, iteration, unresolved gates,
  blockers, next action, regression_ledger, and last proof command so an interrupted run resumes instead
  of restarts.

## Completion promise + loop cap

Frame writes the completion promise before Build. Build -> Forced Verify loops only while the promise is
not yet proven and a fresh, actionable gap remains. Default `max_iterations` is 8 for the Build/Verify
loop; the opt-in critic->fixer escalation keeps its 3-cycle cap below. When the next pass would exceed
the cap, stop and write a forced reflection in `run-state.json`: what keeps failing, the likely root
cause, which requirement is still unproven, whether a previously green check regressed, and the smallest
next action. Each iteration re-runs `regression_ledger`; if a previously green check turns red, stop,
fix that regression, and record `forced_reflection.regressed_previously_green`. Then ask only if the
blocker is requirement-level or needs user consent; otherwise recut the plan and continue only after the
reflection identifies new evidence.

## Roles (each role = a fresh-context subagent by default)

Dispatch is the default, not an option: the conductor runs each role as a separate fresh-context subagent,
so the role's heavy references (this file, `reference/domain-context.md`, `reference/taste-skill-v2.md`,
and the like) load inside the subagent and never accumulate in the conductor's window. The subagent
returns only a short structured result - status, what changed, test output, concerns - not its transcript.
Run independent units in parallel (QA scenario shards, review dimensions, multi-file builds); keep
dependent roles ordered. A trivial single edit skips the loop and edits inline. Build (1) and Verify (4)
are the mandatory core; Critic (2) and Fixer (3) are the OPT-IN escalation for under-specified /
latent-correctness work - otherwise go straight from Build to a forced Verify.

0. **Adversarial plan attack (conditional, no src edits)** - only for under-specified, wide-blast-radius,
   security/data/concurrency, or latent-correctness work. Before Build, dispatch independent critics for
   security, scope, correctness, performance, and operability. Each critic tries to break the plan from
   one angle. Accept only findings grounded in the prose spec, current code/data, or known platform
   rules; convert accepted required risks into failing tests, decision gates, or explicit residual risk.
   Skip this on explicit-spec or tiny work because equal-compute forced verification is the cheaper
   default.

1. **Build** - before the first edit, confirm any blast-radius reaching past the change's explicit
   target has cleared its interview confirm (`reference/interview.md`: approved, AFK-proceeded, or
   safely skipped and logged). Then: smallest correct change; match surrounding style; minimal diff.
   Bug: reproduce with a failing test first. For any shared code/state change past *very easy*, capture a
   neighbor characterization baseline FIRST (`reference/qa.md` "Characterization baseline"). Refactor/
   integrate an existing API: capture its exact-behavior baseline FIRST with the API behavior baseline.
   Capture the run-setup before proof in `delivery-proof.md` and `run-state.json` before the first edit.

2. **Critic** (`agents/code-reviewer.md`; OPT-IN escalation for under-specified / latent-correctness work) - DO NOT edit src or weaken/delete existing tests.
   - Re-read the prose spec and repo/data rules. Enumerate REQUIRED behaviors the existing tests do not
     exercise - especially edges (boundary inputs, error/recovery paths, scoping/precedence, prefix/
     filter behavior, incremental update, concurrency, protocol/state).
   - Requirement threshold: classify each candidate as `must`, `should`, or `ask-user`. Only `must`
     requirements grounded in the prose spec, current/API behavior, repo/data rules, or platform safety
     get failing tests. Do not turn silence into stricter semantics (for example throwing on degenerate
     inputs) when multiple reasonable behaviors exist; record that as an `ask-user` decision gate or
     residual risk.
   - For each `must`, write a NEW FAILING test in a separate file, derived strictly from the spec.
     Prefer black-box behavior tests and properties (roundtrip, idempotency, invariants).
   - Record each surfaced requirement in the run vault's `surfaced-requirements.md`
     (`docs/changelog/<YYYY-MM>/<DD-topic>/surfaced-requirements.md`; create if absent; format in
     `templates/surfaced-requirements.md`): a dated heading, one bullet per `must` requirement - what the
     spec implies, why it is required though the prompt never stated it, and the failing test that now
     covers it (status: open). This is the durable, human-readable trail of what the prompt left implicit.
   - Leave the failing tests red.

3. **Fixer** (`agents/executor.md`) - DO NOT edit test files.
   - Read NOTES + run the suite. Make the failing tests pass with the SMALLEST change.
   - If a critic-authored test appears to encode an `ask-user` choice, contradict current/API behavior, or
     harden semantics not required by the spec or safety, stop and report the decision gate instead of
     optimizing source to it.
   - No padding: add no code that is not required by a failing test or a listed defect. Do not break
     passing tests.

4. **Verify vs ground truth (mandatory core)** (`agents/qa-auditor.md` / `security-reviewer.md`)
   - Forced whole-spec sweep: re-read the FULL prose spec from scratch and, for every stated-or-implied
     behavior - especially each input's degenerate values (null/undefined/empty/boundary) and error/edge
     paths - confirm the code is correct and fix the smallest gap, even when the visible tests are green.
     Re-run the project's REAL tests and loop until no fresh gap appears; report what was verified with
     command output.
   - Code-change scenarios use `reference/qa.md` "Scenario stencil (code changes)", including regression
     scenarios and metamorphic relations when no exact oracle exists.
   - Browser UI changes require `reference/qa.md` browser evidence: `Tool: playwright-cli`,
     fixed-route as-is/to-be captures, and a passing `bash templates/qa-gate.sh <vault> browser`.
     Lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, and a visual guess are not browser QA.
   - Re-run every captured neighbor characterization baseline; unnamed drift is red. API refactor:
     re-capture the same call and diff against the pre-refactor baseline; unintended drift is a red to
     resolve.
   - Close `## Requirement Trace`: every forward row is `met` with a verifying check, and
     `Backward-trace: clean` proves no diff hunk is orphan scope.
   - The mandatory core Verify for neighbor baselines and Requirement Trace closure is fresh-context:
     the code writer's self-review is not a regression gate. Open requirements, unresolved REVISE items,
     and stub/placeholder implementations block done; do not drop them to make the run green.
   - Update the run vault's `surfaced-requirements.md`: mark each surfaced requirement fixed, or note why it stays open.
   - Update `delivery-proof.md`: after evidence, command outputs/artifact paths, decision gates
     (`auto-fix`, `no-op`, `ask-user`), intentional drift, and residual risk. Unresolved `ask-user`
     findings or missing trusted commands block a final done claim and the commit
     (`reference/delivery-gate.md` Commit gate).
   - Update `run-state.json`: phase, iteration, gate status, last proof command, blockers, next action,
     and completion-promise status.

The forced Verify is the mandatory core - drop it only for *very easy* issues; past that, the whole-spec
re-read + re-running the project's REAL tests is REQUIRED, plus DB evidence for data-backed bugs
(`reference/db-access.md`) - DB proves data state but does not replace the red-green test. Loop the
opt-in critic->fixer escalation only while a fresh red appears.

Board (optional): if the Supergoal Board is enabled (`reference/observability.md`), the conductor may
call `sg-emit --phase <P>` at each transition (Frame/Build/Critic/Fixer/Verify/Done). Opt-in and
best-effort - it observes only, never blocks or gates the loop.

## Guardrails (keep it baseline-first, not Goodhart)

- The critic's generated tests are a SIGNAL to surface hidden requirements - NOT the acceptance oracle.
  Final verification is always the project's REAL tests + prose spec. Never weaken/delete a real test,
  never declare done because self-written tests pass while real tests/spec do not.
- Ambiguous edges are not REDs. If a behavior has multiple reasonable interpretations, classify it as
  `ask-user` or residual risk; do not invent stricter semantics just because the prompt is silent.
- Characterization baseline is a regression signal, not a correctness oracle. A known-bug snapshot changes
  only when the bug fix is intentional and named.
- Self-review is not a regression gate: generated explanations can approve behavior drift. Require
  execution evidence, fresh-context verification, and no stub done claims.
- Derive every generated test from the prose spec, not from a guessed rubric; a wrong generated test the
  fixer optimizes to is the failure mode - keep them black-box and spec-anchored.
- Cost: the loop costs more than one build - use it when correctness on behavior the visible tests miss
  matters; for a quick pass, one build is cheaper.
- Stop condition: cap the Build->Verify loop at `max_iterations` (default 8) with forced reflection, and
  cap the critic->fixer loop at 3 cycles; if a 4th critic cycle would start, escalate to the user with
  the open reds instead of grinding. Doubt-theater anti-signal: 2+ cycles that produce findings but
  change no code means the critic is validating, not doubting - stop and recut the critic's spec focus.
