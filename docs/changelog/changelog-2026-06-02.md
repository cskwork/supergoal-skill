# 2026-06-02 - QA phase made machine-enforceable (qa-gate.sh)

## Branch-scoped worktree workflow for coding/debug runs

### Decision

Require every GREENFIELD, DEBUG, and LEGACY run to ask for branch integration details before any repo
mutation: ask the user for the base git branch and target branch, default target to base when the user
only provides one branch, create a dedicated run branch/worktree from base, perform Build/Fix work
inside that worktree, then merge the accepted result into target and remove the worktree only after
user acceptance.

### Reasoning

Multiple agents editing one checkout create avoidable conflicts and make it unclear which dirty state
is authoritative. A branch-scoped worktree gives each run a clean edit surface, keeps the original
checkout available for orchestration and integration, and makes the final merge into the requested
target branch explicit instead of implicit.

## Decision

Convert the QA phase's "drive the app with agent-browser + capture as-is/to-be evidence" rule from
prose (`reference/qa.md`) into a literal, machine-checkable gate, so it matches every other gate in
the skill instead of being instruction-only.

- `templates/qa-gate.sh` (NEW): `qa-gate.sh <vault> <browser|cli>`. For a browser app it requires a
  `## QA` section in `verification.md`, `qa/as-is-*` + `qa/to-be-*` evidence files, an
  `agent-browser doctor` preflight record, a `Tool:` line naming the driver, and — if that driver is
  NOT agent-browser — a `Fallback:` line justifying why agent-browser was impossible. CLI/lib only
  needs a `## QA` section (no browser). Usage errors exit 2, gate failures exit 1, parallel to
  `validate-gate.sh` / `delivery-gate.sh`. NEVER edited to pass.
- `reference/pipeline.md`: GREENFIELD + LEGACY QA exit-gate cells now require `qa-gate.sh` exits 0.
- `agents/qa-tester.md`: rewrote DO/RULES/WRITE/GATE — first browser step is now "check `command -v
  agent-browser`, install if absent, only fall back with a recorded reason"; the `## QA` record MUST
  carry the `Tool:`/`Fallback:` lines and exact `as-is-<view>`/`to-be-<view>` names; GATE invokes
  `qa-gate.sh`.
- `reference/qa.md`: vault-record section now mandates the `Tool:`/`Fallback:` lines and exact evidence
  names; added an "Exit gate (machine-checkable)" section pointing at `qa-gate.sh`.
- `SKILL.md`: added the `qa-gate.sh` row to the Template scripts table.
- `tests/gate-scenarios.test.sh`: added SCENARIO 6 (cases 6.0-6.9) — usage, CLI-passes, missing
  evidence, missing `Tool:`, agent-browser PASS, silent headless-Chrome BLOCKED, fallback+justification
  PASS. Suite now 62/62 green.
- `docs/e2e-test-plan.md`: Tier A table + new A12-A16 subsection document the qa-gate scenarios.

### Follow-up reinforcements (same day)

- **Two-step install** (`reference/qa.md`, `agents/qa-tester.md`): the skill only ran `npm i -g
  agent-browser` and never `agent-browser install` (downloads the Chrome-for-Testing binary, first
  time only). On a fresh machine the CLI is on PATH but `open` fails with no browser — a likely cause
  of the silent fallback. Both files now mandate BOTH steps and state that a missing browser binary is
  NOT "install impossible".
- **Delivery QA backstop** (`templates/delivery-gate.sh`): if the vault has a `qa/` dir (browser-QA
  evidence), delivery now also runs `qa-gate.sh <vault> browser` — defense-in-depth so a non-compliant
  QA cannot slip past the final gate. CLI/DEBUG runs have no `qa/` dir, so they are unaffected. Tests
  2.12-2.13 added; suite now 64/64 green.
- **Contrast gate** (`templates/contrast-gate.mjs`, NEW): the UI/UX rule "contrast is computed, not
  eyeballed" (`reference/ui-ux.md`, taste §14) had no committed enforcement — the QA agent hand-wrote a
  throwaway `_verify_contrast.js` per run (never committed), so the ratio could be eyeballed or
  hallucinated. The new gate splits responsibility: the agent enumerates the text/bg pairs it found
  into `qa/contrast-pairs.json` (`{el, fg, bg, size}`), and the script computes the WCAG 2.x ratios and
  judges them (body AAA >=7, normal AA >=4.5, large >=3, decorative skip). Exit 1 on any sub-threshold
  text pair, exit 2 on usage/parse error. Verified the math reproduces the real workflow-landing
  verification exactly (term-title 4.37 FAIL -> 5.28 PASS after the documented `#8a8275`->`#9a9081`
  fix). Wired into `reference/ui-ux.md` QA overlay + SKILL.md template table; SCENARIO 7 (cases 7.0-7.8)
  added. Suite now 73/73 green.

## Reasoning

- Empirical trigger: the most recent real browser-QA run (`docs/changelog/2026-05-31-polish-readme-landing`)
  did NOT use agent-browser. It rendered with headless Chrome and saved `render-*.png` instead of the
  mandated `as-is/to-be-*.png`. agent-browser was (and is) installed (`agent-browser@0.20.0` on PATH),
  so there was no install excuse — the run simply skipped the sanctioned driver.
- Root cause: QA was the ONLY major gate with no machine-checkable script. Validate, Human Feedback,
  Delivery, and the circuit breaker all have one; the QA exit gate ("golden + edge + a11y pass") was
  pure prose, and `delivery-gate.sh` never inspects `qa/` evidence. So a silent fallback (or a skipped
  browser pass) could not be caught — exactly the false-confidence failure mode the rest of the skill
  is engineered against.
- The 2026-05-31 changelog already flagged this deviation but fixed it with prose only ("root cause was
  runtime non-compliance, not a skill defect"). Prose without enforcement lets the same non-compliance
  recur. This adds the enforcement; the agent-browser-first preference and the modes/gates are unchanged.
- Design choices: the gate takes the app-type explicitly (`browser|cli`) rather than guessing, so a CLI
  run is never wrongly asked for browser evidence; it is wired into the per-mode QA exit gate (not the
  mode-agnostic `delivery-gate.sh`) because QA is conditional on app type; the `Fallback:` line is the
  precise backstop — agent-browser stays preferred, a justified fallback is still allowed, only a SILENT
  fallback fails.

## Supergoal skill wording compression

### Decision

Shorten `SKILL.md` so agent runs spend less context on repeated prose while retaining every operational
contract: conductor-only execution, branch-scoped worktrees, topology selection, Human Feedback,
adversarial Verify, QA/delivery gates, vault files, stop conditions, and final checklist.

### Reasoning

The skill body is itself loaded into agent context. Concise contract language lowers context cost and
scan time, but changing gate names, commands, phase order, or stop conditions would change behavior.
This update compresses wording only; the executable gates and referenced files are unchanged.

## Reference wording compression

### Decision

Compress every `reference/*.md` file so fresh agents spend less context on repeated rationale while
retaining the operational contract: mode pipelines, dispatch roles, vault fields, gate commands,
coverage requirements, QA evidence, LEARN tutoring loop, UI/UX overlay, and design pre-flight rules.

### Reasoning

Reference files are loaded phase-by-phase into agent context. The useful content is the contract:
commands, file shapes, pass/fail conditions, and role boundaries. Long rationale and repeated examples
raise token cost without changing behavior. `reference/taste-skill-v2.md` was converted from a verbatim
vendored copy into a compressed derivative with the upstream source and commit preserved in the banner,
because keeping the full upstream body defeated the context-saving goal.
