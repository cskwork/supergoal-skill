# 2026-06-07 — Eval-skill accuracy fixes + gpt-5.5-low crash/harness test

Continues `changelog-2026-06-06.md` (diagnosis + INLINE fix + v2 scorer + Experiments A/B).

## What

1. **Made the eval methodology itself accurate** — ported the one-off run.mjs fixes into the skill's
   HARNESS-EVAL reference so future evals don't repeat the inaccuracies.
2. **Tested crash-specificity + harness value on gpt-5.5 low reasoning** to answer "is the crash only on
   spark, and does the harness matter on another model".

Changed:
- `reference/harness-eval.md` — 7 accuracy fixes: reachable + uncapped scoring (correct solution can
  reach >=80; no dimension capped below 10); gradient correctness over per-test pass fraction + record
  each check individually (not one all-or-nothing pass); strip eval-internal files from the harness
  reference; new "Runtime fit" section (single non-interactive process => INLINE, never force a
  multi-agent verifier loop into one context window); crash/turn/cost capture matched to the adapter
  (codex-exec emits `command_execution`, a crash is a recorded LOSS); cases must DISCRIMINATE
  (all-pass ceiling = inconclusive, not a tie/win); clarified the RevFactory yamls are specs needing
  authored fixtures (only case-015 runnable). Expanded the Reject list accordingly.
- `docs/experiments/2026-06-06-harness-eval-spark-high-lsp-v2/run.mjs` — added `SG_EVAL_EFFORT` and
  `SG_EVAL_HARNESS_SKILL` (A/B a different SKILL.md for the harness arm).

New:
- `docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-gpt55-low/` — gpt-5.5 low-reasoning run (results.md,
  result-fixed.json, result-orig.json, SKILL.original.md, raw logs).

## gpt-5.5-low results (case-015, v2 scorer)

| run | arm | score | tests | crashed | tokens | wall-clock |
|---|---|---:|---|---|---:|---:|
| fixed skill | baseline | 79 | 6/9 | no | 786K | 211 s |
| fixed skill | harness | 79 | 6/9 | no | 418K | 152 s |
| original skill | baseline | 81 | 7/9 | no | 437K | 190 s |
| original skill | harness (pre-fix) | 79 | 6/9 | no | 353K | 142 s |

**Q1 — is the crash spark-specific? No.** It is a high-reasoning × heavy-payload effect. On gpt-5.5-low
even the original (pre-fix) harness completed cleanly — 47-line log, 0 `reference/`/`templates/` reads,
0 sandbox-rejected debug procs, 0 full-file rewrites — because low reasoning is terse and never unspools
the whole ~332 KB skill tree or the obsessive self-verify loop that exhausted spark-high's window. So you
cannot say "only spark"; the driver is reasoning effort + un-fixed payload. The INLINE fix prevents it at
any effort. (gpt-5.5-**high** with the original skill would be the confirming crash run; not tested.)

**Q2 — does the harness matter on gpt-5.5-low? As cost, not quality.** Both arms tie on outcome
(6-7/9, ~79-81, within run-to-run noise), but the harness uses ~half the tokens and ~25-30% less
wall-clock for the same result. On an easy-for-the-model, low-effort config the harness does not lift
quality (baseline already solves it) but it is cheaper. It clearly matters in the hard/high-reasoning
regime (spark-high: crash/63 -> clean/82, cheaper than baseline).

## Domain-knowledge cases (averaged) — `docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-domain/`

Built 2 self-contained DOMAIN cases (billing tax/discount engine, shipping rate engine), each with an
explicit `RULES.md`; visible tests deliberately omit the subtle rules so the agent must apply the spec.
Fixtures validated (reference passes all; stub passes only visible: billing 4/8, shipping 3/7). Ran
baseline vs harness on spark-high, v2 scorer, INLINE skill.

| case | baseline | harness | baseline tok | harness tok |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| billing-tax | **80, 8/8** | 76, 6/8 | 1.81M | 0.91M |
| shipping-rates | 78, 7/7 | 78, 7/7 | 0.81M | 1.03M |
| (case-015, Exp B) | 81, 7/9 | 82, 6/9 | 4.05M | 2.71M |

Domain-only avg: baseline 79 / pass-frac 1.00, harness 77 / 0.875. All-3 avg: baseline 79.7 / 0.926,
harness 78.7 / 0.806. **Zero crashes across all arms** (INLINE fix holds).

**The domain hypothesis was NOT supported.** The harness tied on shipping and LOST on billing (baseline
perfect 8/8; harness 6/8, missing banker's-rounding and discount-before-tax — it read RULES.md 44x and
ran tests 11x, but implemented two subtle rules wrong with ~half the baseline's tokens). A strong
high-reasoning baseline nails an explicit spec unaided, leaving no room for a quality lift. The harness's
repeatable value is **stability + cost** (no crashes, ~30-50% fewer tokens), NOT quality.

**Caveat:** these cases give the domain rules to the agent as an explicit `RULES.md`, so they test
*applying a stated spec*, not *discovering implicit domain knowledge* — the latter is what the skill's
domain features (ten-rules, domain-context, LEARN-DOMAIN) target. A self-contained one-shot eval cannot
reproduce buried/undocumented domain rules; a fair test needs a real repo (LEGACY/LEARN-DOMAIN).

## Fan-out eval (Option B) — `docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-fanout/`

Built a REAL fan-out harness: the eval script is the Conductor and each role is a separate `codex exec`
(clean context) sharing the sandbox via `.vault/` files - the fresh-context fan-out single-process codex
could not do. Pipeline: plan (analyst) -> build (executor) -> adversarial verify (verifier) -> repair.
(Bug found + fixed: persona files start with `---` YAML frontmatter, which made codex treat the prompt
as a flag - "unexpected argument"; strip frontmatter + lead with a safe header.)

Billing (the case the single-process harness failed 6/8):

| arm | score | tests | tokens |
|---|---:|---|---:|
| baseline | 80 | 8/8 | 0.86M |
| single-process harness | 76 | 6/8 | 0.91M |
| fan-out harness | 80 | 8/8 | 1.47M (plan 0.89M + build 0.58M; verify crashed transiently, repair skipped) |

LSP/case-015 fan-out: baseline 85, 9/9, 4.11M tok / 250 s; fan-out harness 81, **9/9**, 4.64M tok /
1015 s (verify crashed again, same transient infra error). Fan-out recovered correctness (6/9 -> 9/9)
but lost the score (the whole 4-pt gap is one `error_handling` heuristic; both pass all 9) and cost 4x
the wall-clock.

Combined fan-out (2 cases): baseline avg 82.5, fan-out avg 80.5, both pass-fraction 1.00; baseline
cheaper. **Fan-out RECOVERS the correctness the single-process harness throws away (to baseline parity)
but never beats baseline and costs more.** The adversarial verify+repair loop crashed in BOTH fan-out
runs (consistent codex/proxy infra issue) - plan+build alone reached baseline-level pass both times.

## Generated-harness eval (Option 1) — `docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-genharness/`

New hypothesis after the generic skill showed no lift: generate a TASK-SPECIFIC harness first, then A/B
no-harness vs generated-harness. Phase 1 = a focused `codex exec` reads ONLY RULES.md + visible tests +
the stub and writes `harness/checklist.md` + `harness/selftest.mjs` (spec-derived verifier; never sees the
hidden tests). Phase 2 = solve with/without that harness, scored on the same hidden+visible suite. Fairness
guards: generator sandbox excludes the hidden test; generated `harness/` removed before scoring.

| case | no-harness | gen-harness | baseline tok | harness tok |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|
| billing-tax | 80, 8/8 | **80, 8/8** (tie) | 1.02M | 2.09M |
| lsp/case-015 | 85, 9/9 | **81, 7/9** (loss) | 2.05M | 6.30M |

Combined: baseline 82.5 / pass-frac 1.00; gen-harness 80.5 / 0.889; tokens ~2.7x; wall-clock 2.0-2.4x;
zero crashes both arms.

**This is the strongest negative yet, because the mechanism worked perfectly.** On billing the generator
produced a rigorous task-specific verifier (checklist named every subtle rule; selftest asserted them with
concrete values incl. banker's 0.5->0 ties), the build satisfied it (selftest green, no repair), hidden
passed 8/8 — and it produced an EXACT tie with no-harness (all 8 tests AND all 10 dimensions identical) at
~2x cost. On lsp gen-harness actually LOST (7/9 vs 9/9) at ~3x cost: the generated selftest covered the two
failing rules (#7 syntax-recovery, #9/#10 prefix+signature completion) and passed, yet the real hidden
tests for those rules failed — **Goodhart**: the generated verifier is a lossy proxy of the spec, "make the
selftest pass" invited overfitting to that proxy plus a false done-signal, so the solver stopped BELOW a
baseline that read the prose spec directly. (Honest caveat: lsp harness arms are noisy across experiments —
6/9, 9/9, 7/9 — so this is partly variance; the robust fact is baseline is consistently 9/9 and harness
forms average below it.)

Sharper WHY: a harness adds value by SURFACING requirements. When the spec is fully given as RULES.md, a
strong high-reasoning baseline already extracts all of it, so a generated verifier only re-packages the
same information at extra cost — and can hurt by becoming an overfit target.

## Grand conclusion (7 experiments, 3 cases, 2 models, 4 harness forms)

The supergoal harness — single-process, INLINE, fan-out, or task-specific generated verifier — at best
**matches** a strong baseline on functional correctness and **never beats it**; it always costs more
(2-3x tokens, 2-4x wall-clock). The generated-verifier form can even do WORSE (lsp 7/9 vs 9/9) via Goodhart
overfitting to the generated proxy. Its one durable positive is the INLINE fix preventing the original
crash. Every case is self-contained with an explicit RULES.md spec — the regime SKILL.md says to skip — so
this whole line under-tests the skill's intended multi-file / implicit-domain value. The mechanism is now
clear: a harness only helps when requirements must be SURFACED; an explicit spec hands them to the baseline
for free, leaving no headroom. The only place the skill could still win is a real repo with undocumented
domain rules (LEGACY/LEARN-DOMAIN), where the baseline cannot extract the spec for free — which a one-shot
self-contained eval cannot reproduce.

## Still open
- The one untested regime: a real multi-file repo with implicit/undocumented domain rules.
- The adversarial verify+repair role never ran (transient codex infra crash both times); its unique
  value is still unmeasured, though plan+build already matched baseline.
- Fair domain test: a real repo with implicit/undocumented domain rules (the eval format hands explicit
  specs to the baseline for free, under-testing the skill's intended domain advantage).
- Confirming run: gpt-5.5-high + original skill (expected to reproduce the crash).
- Consider whether INLINE's efficiency is under-verifying subtle requirements (billing 6/8 with half the
  tokens) — add spec-derived verification, not just running the provided visible tests.

## Decision: baseline-first rewrite (strip the disproven gated ceremony)

Acting on the grand conclusion, replaced the gated build/debug machinery with a **baseline-first default
loop** and deleted only the forced ceremony the evals disproved. Scope settled over four user rounds:
keep every separate-purpose capability, strip only the build/debug gates.

**Deleted (12 files):** `templates/{human-feedback-gate.mjs, delivery-gate.sh, validate-gate.sh,
circuit-breaker.mjs, cycle-bound.mjs, state.json}`, `reference/{pipeline.md, vault.md, experts.md,
quality-gates.md}`, `agents/{verifier.md, completeness-critic.md}`. (Git-recoverable; not a separate
history rewrite.)

**Kept (explicit user carve-outs):** HARNESS-MAKE/HARNESS-EVAL utilities, SKILL-MINE, QA-ONLY, LEARN/
LEARN-DOMAIN, `code-reviewer`/`security-reviewer` agents, domain-context/-rules. Grep confirmed the
utilities are self-contained (reference only their own templates), so they survive the deletion intact.

**Rewrote** `SKILL.md` (baseline-first: frame -> surface hidden requirements -> smallest change, test-first
-> verify vs the REAL tests + prose spec, never a generated proxy -> stop on green; all modes still routable)
and `README.md` (dropped the gated-pipeline/committee narrative; documents baseline-first + the evidence).
**Patched** three kept files for dangling links to deleted items: `reference/learn-domain.md` (made the
ground/completeness steps self-contained, dropped `experts.md`/`verifier`/`completeness-critic` refs),
`reference/debugging.md` (dropped the `vault.md` ledger pointer), `agents/analyst.md` (dropped
`validate-gate.sh`, now "confirm demand/scope with the user").

**Rationale:** a harness adds value only by SURFACING requirements; an explicit spec hands them to a strong
baseline for free (no headroom), and a generated proxy verifier can actively hurt (Goodhart). The
baseline-first loop keeps the one durable lever (surface hidden rules) and the only verification that
helped (re-run the project's real tests), and drops the rest.

**Note / next:** HARNESS-MAKE was kept on "no direct evidence" — it was never itself an experiment (the
gen-harness eval generated a spec-derived *verifier*, not a HARNESS-MAKE agent-team). Open follow-up:
use HARNESS-MAKE to generate a harness-agent and A/B it vs a no-harness baseline-agent on the eval cases
to get that direct evidence.

## HARNESS-MAKE eval result (billing) - direct evidence

Ran that follow-up (`docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-harnessmake/`). A `codex exec` ran
HARNESS-MAKE proper (read `reference/harness-make.md` + `harness-patterns.md` + the case) and designed a
3-role pipeline to `.harness/pipeline.json`; phase 2 executed it as fresh codex roles vs a no-harness
baseline, scored on the same hidden+visible suite.

billing: baseline 80, 8/8, 1.73M tok / 139 s; **HARNESS-MAKE 80, 8/8, 3.89M tok / 395 s** (design 0.36M +
planner 1.06M + implementer 1.24M + adversarial-reviewer 1.21M). **Exact tie - all 8 tests and all 10
dimensions identical - at ~2.25x tokens / ~2.8x wall-clock.** `design_ok=true`: the designed pipeline
(planner -> implementer -> adversarial-reviewer) was sound, anti-Goodhart (briefs name RULES.md + real
tests as source of truth), crash-free, and hit 8/8 - so this is a clean direct measurement, not a degraded
run. lsp/case-015 then **lost**: baseline 85, 9/9, 3.96M tok / 239 s; **HARNESS-MAKE 80, 7/9, 11.62M tok /
860 s** (~2.9x tok / 3.6x wall). `design_ok=true`, a 4-role pipeline (planner -> implementer -> qa-reviewer
-> adversarial-reviewer) with TWO review roles - and it still missed the exact same two hidden rules the
gen-harness verifier missed (prefix-filtered completion signatures; syntax-recovery semantic diagnostics).
The review roles caught nothing the baseline got for free reading the whole prose spec in one context;
role decomposition fragments attention and loses holistic coverage.

n=2 combined: baseline avg 82.5 / pass-frac 1.00; HARNESS-MAKE avg 80 / 0.889; ~2.7x tokens; up to 3.6x
wall-clock; zero crashes. **HARNESS-MAKE reproduces the universal pattern - tie then loss, never a win - at
~2.7x cost, with a clean well-designed pipeline each time (failure is structural, not execution).**

Caveats: n=2 (billing + lsp); and this measures HARNESS-MAKE output as a one-shot coding harness on
explicit-spec tasks - a subset of its stated purpose (designing *reusable* harnesses for ongoing
workflows), which a one-shot eval cannot capture.

## Live re-run: new baseline-first skill vs plain codex (case-015 LSP) - `docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-lsp-skill-vs-baseline/`

First INLINE run of the post-rewrite baseline-first `SKILL.md` against a no-skill baseline on the hard LSP
case (spark-high, fresh sandboxes, hidden tests injected after each arm; harness arm confirmed to read
`harness-ref/SKILL.md` 3x and route via the skill).

| arm | quality | real tests | false-GREEN | tokens | wall | crashed |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| baseline | 81 | 7/9 | 2 | 1.49M | 174 s | no |
| harness | 82 | 8/9 | 1 | 2.56M | 190 s | no |

**Harness narrowly WON this single run** (pass-count + quality + one fewer false-GREEN) at 1.72x tokens.
The win is the hidden `completion prefix + signatures` rule, which baseline shipped broken and the harness
caught after recording explicit assumptions (the skill's surface/verify discipline). Both arms still miss
the hardest hidden rule (syntax recovery + semantic diagnostics).

**Still `Not proven`, and within noise.** Same model/effort/case INLINE run in Exp B was baseline 81/7/9 vs
**harness 82/6/9** - the harness arm there *lost* the test vector. Across runs of the same config the harness
arm swung 6/9 -> 8/9, so a +1-test/+1-point delta is variance, not a proven lift. Robust cross-run facts
hold: baseline extracts the explicit spec cheaply (this baseline 7/9 at 1.49M tok is the cheapest yet), the
harness always costs more, and the hardest hidden rule defeats both. What this run uniquely adds: the first
INLINE data point where the skill's verify discipline beat the baseline on the vector rather than tying/
losing - directionally the mechanism the skill claims, but n=1.

## Experiment #1: underspecified greenfield (n=3) - `docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-underspecified/`

Tested the hypothesis that thin prompts (no RULES.md) create headroom for the skill's requirement-surfacing
step. 3 cases (csv RFC4180, lru recency, semver prerelease/build), visible=happy-path only, hidden=implicit
standard behavior injected after each arm. Pre-flight proved stubs fail visible and reference impls pass all.

| case | baseline hidden | harness hidden | b/h quality | b/h tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| csv | 5/5 | 5/5 | 82/82 | 335k/687k |
| lru | 4/4 | 4/4 | 85/82 | 229k/587k |
| semver | 5/5 | 5/5 | 85/85 | 624k/1010k |
| agg | 14/14 | 14/14 | 252/249 | 1.19M/2.28M (1.92x) |

**Hypothesis REFUTED - all three are ceiling effects** (both arms 14/14). Reason: the implicit requirements
were PUBLIC domain standards already in the strong model's training, so a thin prompt doesn't hide them; the
baseline implements them perfectly unaided. The skill added zero correctness, slightly lower coarse quality,
at 1.92x tokens. Confirms the skill's own "skip for trivial tasks" guidance.

Sharpened conclusion (now n=4 fresh cases today): the only harness win all day was lsp prefix-completion -
a requirement UNDER-SPECIFIED by the visible test. Headroom exists only where the requirement is genuinely
unknown to the model. Per "update skill if proven more effective": **bar not met, no effectiveness edit made.**
Next real test = repo-local / proprietary implicit rules (LEGACY regime), where the requirement is not public
knowledge and not in the model's head.

## harness-eval corpus fixed to validated RevFactory hard/expert cases only

Per user direction, `reference/harness-eval.md` now mandates drawing every eval case from the validated
RevFactory specs in `templates/harness-eval-cases/` (the 15 seeded cases) - never inventing ad-hoc cases.
Use the discriminating tier only: expert 007-015 (interpreter, microservice, sql-engine, crdt, raft-kv,
spreadsheet, bytecode-vm, event-sourcing, lsp) + hard 002/005. Rationale: today's csv/lru/semver ad-hoc
cases all ceiling-out (14/14 both arms) and prove nothing; the RevFactory expert cases are upstream-validated
discriminators. Added a matching Reject bullet ("Inventing ad-hoc eval cases ..."). Only case-015-lsp has a
runnable fixture; the rest are specs needing fixtures authored from the case-015 fixture+scorer shape.

## Verifier-loop reconciliation (DONE)

Demoted the adversarial-verifier + repair loop from a PRESCRIBED eval stage to RECORD-ONLY, consistent with
baseline-first: `reference/harness-eval.md` (pipeline line 54 drops "Adversarial Verify -> Repair Loop";
step 4 reframed "the eval does NOT impose a verifier/repair loop - record whatever the harness ran
natively"), report template (`## Adversarial Verification Loop` -> `## Verification (harness-native + ground
truth)`), and contract test (repointed the SKILL.md pipeline assertion to the new verifier-loop-free pipeline
in harness-eval.md). Ground-truth verification (machine + hidden checks, applied equally to both arms) is
preserved. `tests/harness-eval-contract.test.sh` now **126 passed, 0 failed** (was 125/1).

Separate PRE-EXISTING dead-test debt (NOT from this session - confirmed by stashing these edits and
re-running): the baseline-first + HARNESS-MAKE removals left tests for deleted features failing -
`tests/harness-make-contract.test.sh` (0/14, removed HARNESS-MAKE), `tests/harness-contract.test.sh` (0/16,
removed HARNESS-MAKE references reference/harness-make.md etc.), `tests/gate-scenarios.test.sh` (34/69,
exit 127 = removed validate/delivery gate scripts). These assert removed code; they should be deleted or
reconciled in a dedicated cleanup.

## 5-CLI cross-harness eval (gpt-5.5 @ low) — new

`docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-5cli-gpt55-low/` (run.mjs, orchestrate.sh, results.md,
report.md, result.json, raw/).

### What / why
User asked: same gpt-5.5 at low reasoning across five wrappers — oh-my-pi (omp), hermes, bare codex,
codex+AGENTS.md rules, codex+supergoal — on a hard RevFactory task; accurate scoring, recommend best.
Extends the 2-arm case-015 scorer to 5 arms. Same fixture/hidden-tests/9-checks/v2 scorer; the ONLY
variable is the wrapper. All five reach the SAME gpt-5.5 via the local headroom proxy (codex `/v1`,
hermes `/backend-api/codex`, omp `openai-codex/gpt-5.5`), so it is a clean A/B/C/D/E on the harness.

### Decisions / reasoning
- Reused the proven case-015 fixture+scorer verbatim; only arm-runners + per-adapter cost parsing +
  5-way reporting are new. Reuse over reinvention; keeps results comparable to prior runs.
- Arm isolation: bare/supergoal suppress global `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` via `project_doc_max_bytes=0`;
  agents arm loads it (= the user's Ten Commandments). Verified clean from transcripts (signature
  text `Ten Commandments`/`CodeGraph`/`baseline-first` present only where intended; the "supergoal"
  hits in the bare log were the sandbox PATH, not skill use).
- hermes reasoning isn't a CLI flag — orchestrate.sh backs up `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, sets
  `reasoning_effort: low`, runs, and restores on EXIT trap (verified restored to xhigh; no permanent
  mutation). codex uses `-c model_reasoning_effort=low`; omp uses `--thinking low`.
- omp `--mode json` re-emits the full accumulated message per token delta (O(n^2); 64–106 MB). The
  first run hit node's `spawnSync` maxBuffer and killed omp mid-implementation (a HARNESS bug, not an
  omp failure) — reran omp streaming stdout to a file fd and parsing only the final `agent_end` line,
  then trimming the log. The corrected omp run finished cleanly at 7/9.
- Tokens are NOT cross-CLI comparable (codex=final cumulative; omp=summed-per-turn, inflated;
  hermes=not exposed in -Q). Ranked on wall-clock + tool-calls + result instead.

### Result (n=1, directional)
4-way tie at 7/9 / quality 81: bare codex, codex+supergoal, ohmypi, hermes. codex+AGENTS.md is the sole
loser (6/9, q79) AND costliest (1.52x bare tokens, longest wall-clock, most tool calls). Every arm
shipped false-GREEN (visible 5/5, 2–3 hidden behaviors broken); `completion prefix+signatures` missed
by all five (a model/effort ceiling — prior high-effort run got it). Treatments only reshuffle WHICH
hidden test passes, never raise the count above bare.

### Recommendation
Best overall = bare codex (top result, lowest codex cost, simplest); hermes matches it with the lowest
wall-clock/fewest tool calls. Added rule/skill scaffolding adds cost without lifting the score; the
coding-rules AGENTS.md is net-negative for this task class at low effort. The real lever for the
unshipped hidden behaviors is reasoning effort, not the harness. Corroborates the existing
baseline-first finding across a broader, cross-CLI configuration. n=1 ⇒ directional, not proven.

## Looped self-improvement vs single run (bare codex, gpt-5.5 @ low) — new

`docs/experiments/2026-06-07-codex-loop-vs-single-gpt55-low/` (run.mjs, results.md, report.md,
result.json, raw/).

### What / why
User: on ONE task (case-015 LSP), compare bare codex run once vs bare codex + 3 fresh-context
review/verify/improve loops over the same code. Same model/effort/fixture/scorer as the 5-CLI eval.

### Decisions / reasoning
- loop = build pass + 3 improve passes; each improve pass is a fresh `codex exec` reading the current
  files (no shared context), told to review vs task + visible tests and fix gaps; npm test each time.
  single = build pass only. Build prompt identical across arms (loop == single + extra passes).
- Score snapshotted after EVERY pass to capture the improvement trajectory, on a throwaway COPY so the
  loop never sees hidden tests.
- YARDSTICK FIX: an initial run produced "10/9" because an improve pass added its own tests to the
  visible suite, inflating the denominator. Fixed scoreSnapshot to restore the CANONICAL visible+hidden
  tests on the scoring copy, so a loop cannot change the yardstick (test_coverage becomes a neutral
  constant). Re-ran after the fix.
- n = 3 single seeds + 2 loop seeds (loop is 4 passes/run, token-heavy).

### Result (directional)
single: 6-7/9 (mean 6.67), ~493k tok, ~181s. loop final: 7/9 both seeds, ~3.24M tok (6.6x), ~991s
(5.5x). Trajectory: s1 6->7->7->7, s2 7->7->7->7. Looping never exceeded the single-run ceiling (7/9);
only the first loop helped, and only by rescuing a below-median draft (6->7); loops 2-3 added source
lines but no score. No pass ever cleared `completion prefix+signatures` (the gpt-5.5-low ceiling); loop
finals also still miss `parser recovery`.

### Recommendation
3-loop self-improvement not worth it for spec-complete tasks at low effort: same 7/9 as one run at
5-7x cost. Its only benefit (variance reduction, rescuing a bad draft) is cheaper via re-rolling a
single run. To break above 7/9, raise reasoning effort, not loop count - re-running the same model at
the same effort plateaus at its ceiling. Same lesson as 5-CLI: spend budget on effort, not added
iteration/machinery. Corroborates baseline-first.

## Archon workflow vs plain Claude — case-015 LSP (claude-vs-claude, n=1) — new

Dir: `docs/experiments/2026-06-07-harness-eval-archon-workflow-vs-baseline/`.

### What / why
Tested whether driving an agent through an **Archon** workflow (coleam00/Archon v0.4.1, the
agentic-coding CLI that runs workflows in git worktrees) beats a plain agent on a hard task. The
harness under test is the Archon workflow itself (not the supergoal skill).

### Codex was structurally infeasible — pivoted to claude-vs-claude
Original plan was codex `gpt-5.3-codex-spark` (to match the pi cross-agent matrix). Proven impossible
on ChatGPT-subscription auth: codex then offers only the **spark** family, and Archon's bundled
`@openai/codex-sdk` always attaches an `image_generation` tool that spark rejects (**HTTP 400**).
Plain `codex exec` is unaffected (never attaches it). Not fixable by Archon version (v0.3.10==v0.4.1),
codex binary swap (0.42 -> 401; 0.137 -> 400), or `~/.codex/config.toml [tools] image_generation=false`;
non-spark models are "not supported with a ChatGPT account"; no API key per constraint. The **claude**
provider runs end-to-end locally (global auth, SQLite, no Docker/Supabase/key), so the question was
tested claude-vs-claude with model held constant = `sonnet`.

### Setup
baseline = plain `claude -p` (no Archon). harness = same sonnet model via a single-node Archon workflow
calling the bundled `archon-implement` command, `--no-worktree` in a git-init'd sandbox. Forked the
existing supergoal harness runner; only the two arm executors + cost parsing changed. Codex auth recipe
discovered (now moot): Archon needs `CODEX_*` stripped from `~/.archon/.env` so codex self-auths, plus
`CODEX_BIN_PATH` at an OAuth-capable binary. First baseline attempt was rate-limited ("session limit");
re-ran clean after reset (both arms crashed=false).

### Result (this run)
Identical machine-check vector: both 6/9 behavior + 3/3 syntax = 9/12. Quality 83 (baseline) vs 82
(harness) — one point on `error_handling`, scorer noise. Both miss the SAME 3 hidden rules (completion
prefix+signatures, local-scope definition, syntax-recovery diagnostics). Wall-clock: baseline 434 s vs
harness **546 s (+26%)**. Harness tokens not surfaced by Archon's CLI log (unmeasured, not zero); baseline
657k tok exact.

### Decision
**Not proven — no harness benefit observed.** The Archon workflow caught nothing the plain baseline
missed, tied on the test vector, was a point lower on quality, and cost more wall-clock. Confound noted:
baseline (claude CLI) loads the user's global CLAUDE.md while the Archon SDK path does not — a mild edge
to the baseline, not the harness. Consistent with baseline-first: workflow ceremony costs more without
beating a strong baseline on an explicit-spec task. (Notably the supergoal skill harness on this same
case once caught the prefix-completion rule; the Archon workflow did not.)

## Role-separated loop beats the ceiling (bare codex, gpt-5.5 @ low) — new

`docs/experiments/2026-06-07-codex-roleloop-vs-baseline-gpt55-low/` (run.mjs, results.md, report.md,
result.json, raw/).

### What / why
Follow-up to "naive loop = no lift". User picked option A: a role-separated loop that stays at low
effort but gives the loop an independent signal. role_loop = build + critic -> fixer -> verifier
(fresh context each): critic writes spec-derived FAILING tests (no src edits), fixer makes them pass
(no test edits, no padding), verifier guards regressions. Compared to single + the prior naive band on
the same case-015/gpt-5.5/low.

### Decisions / reasoning
- Yardstick fixed: score on a copy whose test/ dir is reset to canonical visible+hidden, so the
  critic's generated tests can't move the denominator or test_coverage, and Goodhart (fixer optimizing
  to wrong critic tests) would show as a canonical DROP. None observed (visible stayed 5/5).
- Lean run after a proxy stall: an initial 14-pass run hung when the headroom proxy degraded ("failed
  to refresh available models"), a pass sat ~19 min at 0% CPU. Killed it, smoke-confirmed proxy
  recovery, set per-pass timeout to 8 min, reran single x1 + role x2 (naive reused from sibling run).

### Result (directional, n=2 role)
role_loop 8-9/9 (mean 8.5, q82-85), tokens ~2.91M, ~811s. Trajectory s1 6->6->8->8, s2 8->8->9->9.
First config in the whole series to exceed 7/9 from a loop AND to hit a perfect 9/9. Beats naive_loop
(7/7, ~3.24M tok, ~991s) on BOTH outcome and cost. critic never moves the score (no src edits); fixer
carries the jump; verifier == fixer both seeds (redundant -> droppable, ~25% cheaper).

### Headline finding (refines prior conclusion)
`completion prefix+signatures` was missed by EVERY arm in every prior experiment (5-CLI, single,
naive) -> earlier called a "gpt-5.5-low capability/effort ceiling, raise effort." WRONG: role_loop s2
cleared it at the same low effort. It was a SIGNAL ceiling - no arm had a failing test for it (the
visible completion test only probes an empty prefix). The critic turned the prose requirement into a
failing test; the fixer cleared it. So the missing lever was independent signal, not effort.

### Recommendation
To beat the single-run ceiling without raising effort: role-separated loop (author-independent critic
writes spec-derived failing tests -> fixer, no padding). Confirms supergoal's "surface hidden
requirements" (made executable) is the one move that beats a strong baseline; refines "loops don't
help" to "naive loops don't; critic->fixer does." Still ~4-6x a single run's tokens. n=2/1 case ->
replicate (more seeds + a 2nd expert case) before treating as proven.
